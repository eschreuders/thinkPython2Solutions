if
this
misfortune
becomes
known
you
must
help
me
out
of
the
difficulty
without
the
affair
coming
into
the
papers
we
will
do
our
best
but
we
cannot
guarantee
success
and
i
must
say
that
it
is
an
invaluable
advantage
to
have
the
police
on
our
side
the
police
must
know
nothing
about
it
the
business
lies
entirely
between
my
clients
and
myself
i
should
lose
all
my
customers
at
once
if
through
the
slightest
indiscretion
they
were
led
to
suspect
their
valuable
property
to
have
passed
into
other
hands
pro
tem
but
suppose
some
of
them
wish
to
redeem
the
property
upon
which
you
have
advanced
them
money
they
are
not
likely
to
do
that
at
present
the
season
has
been
an
exceptionally
gay
one
and
a
gay
season
is
always
an
expensive
one
society
dames
will
be
glad
to
leave
their
plate
and
jewellery
at
their
bankers
until
their
most
pressing
debts
are
settled
meanwhile
i
have
sufficient
confidence
in
your
acumen
to
hope
that
you
will
speedily
recover
the
missing
goods
we
could
not
help
thinking
that
mr
davisons
confidence
in
us
was
too
overweening
to
be
anything
but
embarrassing
even
though
our
vanity
was
flattered
by
having
the
sole
onus
of
responsibility
for
the
recovery
of
stolen
goods
fixed
upon
us
the
facts
are
briefly
as
follows
–
mr
davison
drove
a
very
peculiar
trade
in
society
he
figured
as
a
man
of
culture
and
of
large
independent
means
he
lived
in
one
of
the
most
costly
of
the
many
palatial
flats
in
which
opulent
london
loves
to
disport
itself
and
dispensed
his
hospitality
on
a
very
lavish
and
comprehensive
scale
assisted
by
his
wife
a
woman
who
was
very
beautiful
and
as
clever
as
himself
he
gave
receptions
to
which
the
titled
and
untitled
flower
of
english
aristocracy
thought
itself
fortunate
to
be
invited
and
spent
vast
sums
in
apparently
ostentatious
extravagance
but
this
extravagance
was
really
the
medium
by
which
he
found
opportunities
of
gauging
and
of
trading
upon
the
social
and
financial
position
of
his
hosts
of
acquaintances
who
never
dreamed
that
the
wherewithal
of
the
splendid
hospitality
at
which
they
wondered
was
derived
from
their
own
needs
mr
davison
was
really
a
moneylender
on
a
huge
scale
and
had
at
least
halfadozen
flourishing
westend
establishments
at
one
of
them
he
traded
under
a
fictitious
name
as
a
dealer
in
gold
and
silver
plate
and
at
another
under
another
alias
he
made
costly
jewellery
his
principal
line
from
still
another
establishment
he
drew
plethoric
profits
by
lending
large
sums
of
money
on
valuables
at
another
he
advanced
money
on
real
estate
at
huge
interest
and
at
one
or
two
others
he
drove
an
equally
lucrative
trade
on
somewhat
different
lines
but
at
none
of
his
shops
did
he
ever
put
in
a
personal
appearance
though
he
was
actually
the
guiding
spirit
of
them
all
he
had
one
little
room
in
his
flat
to
which
no
one
was
ever
allowed
to
penetrate
except
himself
and
his
wife
connecting
this
room
with
his
various
establishments
was
an
elaborate
system
of
telephoning
and
from
this
socalled
study
he
was
able
to
direct
the
multifarious
threads
of
his
vast
business
add
to
his
acquisitive
capacity
the
fact
that
he
had
the
power
of
winning
the
confidence
of
others
to
an
extraordinary
degree
and
it
will
be
seen
how
much
more
easy
it
was
for
him
to
manage
so
complicated
a
business
than
for
a
man
with
less
tact
and
polish
or
for
a
man
whose
wife
was
inferior
to
mrs
davison
who
was
her
husbands
very
double
in
cunning
and
suavity
and
then
they
both
had
such
a
clever
way
of
advising
their
friends
out
of
their
difficulties
that
success
was
a
foregone
conclusion
with
them
do
you
know
lady
c
would
be
mrs
davisons
advice
to
a
bosom
friend
whose
present
condition
was
that
of
chronic
impecuniosity
but
whose
future
was
assured
wealth
if
i
were
you
i
would
do
just
what
dear
gerald
and
i
had
to
do
a
year
or
two
ago
when
we
were
at
our
wits
end
for
money
owing
to
a
temporary
depreciation
of
land
values
we
knew
that
all
would
come
right
in
time
and
we
bought
a
couple
of
thousand
pounds
worth
of
jewellery
from
edison
co
and
a
thousand
pounds
worth
of
gold
and
silver
plate
from
meesons
but
how
could
it
help
you
to
go
several
thousand
pounds
deeper
into
debt
my
dear
lady
c
how
unsophisticated
you
are
we
pawned
the
things
for
a
thousand
pounds
at
grinlings
its
a
capital
place
for
business
of
that
sort
no
questions
asked
and
no
fear
of
things
being
lent
on
hire
as
sometimes
happens
you
see
we
got
all
that
ready
money
without
laying
any
out
and
paid
all
up
as
soon
as
we
were
better
off
the
result
of
some
such
talk
would
be
that
lady
c
and
her
kindred
spirits
would
do
a
rather
tall
business
with
edison
meeson
and
grinling
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
all
three
were
embodied
in
the
persons
of
davison
and
his
charming
sympathetic
wife
or
the
prospective
heir
to
vast
estates
would
forestall
his
inheritance
by
mortgaging
his
interest
at
robsons
estate
office
at
a
ruinous
percentage
being
advised
thereto
by
his
friend
davison
it
was
this
complicated
nature
of
his
business
which
made
davison
so
nervous
about
employing
the
police
he
didnt
mind
trusting
us
but
he
gave
the
force
more
credit
for
bungling
and
preferred
to
lose
the
things
which
after
all
were
really
his
own
since
they
were
not
paid
for
rather
than
risk
exposure
grinlings
didnt
look
at
all
like
a
pawnshop
and
it
was
oddly
enough
only
patronised
by
people
who
knew
the
davisons
or
some
of
their
friends
to
all
outward
seeming
it
was
but
a
middleclass
private
dwelling
hardly
likely
to
tempt
a
gang
of
burglars
even
the
servants
were
supposed
to
be
in
profound
ignorance
of
the
nature
of
mr
grinlings
business
or
of
the
contents
of
a
certain
room
on
the
third
storey
into
which
they
were
never
admitted
do
you
think
mr
grinling
requires
a
new
set
of
blinds
for
his
windows
inquired
mr
bell
if
so
i
will
send
a
man
to
measure
the
windows
and
to
show
you
patterns
mr
davison
had
employed
messrs
bell
and
white
before
and
understood
my
uncles
drift
at
once
by
all
means
he
replied
you
will
find
him
prepared
to
receive
your
messenger
in
an
hour
just
an
hour
later
adam
henniker
was
interviewing
mr
grinling
who
had
already
been
advised
of
the
intended
visit
could
the
two
manservants
have
seen
the
systematic
way
in
which
the
supposed
blindmaker
pried
peeped
and
smelled
in
every
corner
and
over
every
inch
of
the
room
from
which
the
theft
had
been
made
they
would
have
been
greatly
surprised
as
it
was
they
were
a
little
astonished
for
the
man
actually
went
into
the
back
area
and
measured
the
lower
windows
for
outside
sunblinds
my
goodness
i
wonder
whatll
happen
next
said
the
housemaid
the
master
must
be
thinking
of
getting
married
and
if
he
brings
a
missis
here
we
shall
have
to
mind
our
ps
and
qs
last
week
the
sweeps
and
a
lot
of
new
furniture
and
this
week
new
blinds
were
comin
out
aint
we
looks
like
it
me
and
my
missis
would
like
to
come
out
too
said
adam
henniker
but
we
cant
afford
new
furniture
the
whitewashers
and
sweeps
is
enough
for
us
do
you
have
a
decent
sort
of
sweep
round
here
oh
yes
he
did
very
well
and
was
particularly
clean
i
never
knew
a
sweep
take
such
pains
over
a
job
he
lives
round
the
corner
in
the
back
street
that
same
evening
adam
henniker
imparted
his
discoveries
to
me
and
invoked
my
aid
in
the
matter
he
had
found
certain
marks
on
the
windowsill
spout
and
the
flooring
of
the
looted
room
which
his
magnifying
glass
and
his
sense
of
smell
assured
him
were
produced
by
soot
and
as
soot
is
generally
associated
with
people
whose
garments
are
habitually
covered
with
it
he
had
no
hesitation
in
deciding
that
the
sweep
must
have
become
suspicious
as
to
the
contents
of
the
closed
chamber
and
that
he
had
made
a
very
profitable
nocturnal
visit
to
it
aided
by
the
spout
and
by
the
implements
of
his
real
trade
i
dont
know
how
the
people
failed
to
hear
the
noise
that
must
have
been
made
continued
adam
for
the
man
fell
and
hurt
himself
severely
i
saw
evidences
of
this
in
the
area
there
were
some
spots
of
blood
on
the
ground
and
there
were
marks
on
the
wall
i
should
fancy
that
he
must
have
tied
the
bag
of
jewellery
on
his
back
and
that
he
was
coming
down
the
spout
again
when
he
slipped
and
was
supported
by
his
trousers
until
they
gave
way
and
left
this
piece
of
cloth
hanging
on
a
nail
which
projects
from
the
wall
i
went
to
the
sweeps
house
ostensibly
to
order
a
chimney
to
be
swept
but
was
told
that
the
man
had
hurt
himself
at
his
trade
and
was
laid
up
with
a
broken
leg
it
is
now
your
turn
to
take
the
matter
up
i
saw
no
difficulty
in
doing
this
for
my
work
seemed
cut
and
dried
the
next
morning
witnessed
a
metamorphosis
in
my
appearance
i
presented
myself
at
the
sweeps
house
in
the
garb
of
a
charity
nurse
and
said
that
i
had
heard
there
was
a
man
lying
ill
there
and
was
willing
to
nurse
him
two
or
three
hours
a
day
as
it
happened
the
sweeps
wife
was
very
glad
of
my
services
for
though
the
fellows
leg
was
not
broken
he
had
sustained
so
many
injuries
that
i
marvelled
how
he
had
managed
to
reach
home
with
his
booty
i
concluded
that
the
wife
was
ignorant
of
the
real
cause
of
her
husbands
accident
and
of
the
robbery
or
she
would
not
have
trusted
me
to
sit
at
the
now
delirious
mans
bedside
while
she
attended
to
her
household
duties
in
the
room
which
served
as
a
kitchen
it
did
not
take
me
long
to
discover
that
my
patient
kept
a
feverish
hold
upon
a
small
key
this
key
fitted
a
box
that
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
a
judiciously
administered
opiate
enabled
me
to
get
it
into
my
possession
at
a
time
when
mrs
sweep
had
gone
upon
a
lengthy
errand
in
five
minutes
my
task
was
accomplished
i
opened
the
box
withdrew
a
wellfilled
black
leather
bag
disposed
of
its
contents
in
my
multitudinous
pockets
put
the
key
back
in
the
hand
of
the
sleeping
man
after
locking
the
empty
bag
in
the
box
again
and
was
ready
to
leave
when
the
woman
came
back
my
readers
will
not
be
surprised
to
hear
that
i
did
not
go
back
again
but
lest
the
thief
should
blame
his
wife
for
the
loss
of
his
booty
we
caused
a
letter
to
be
sent
to
him
in
which
we
asserted
that
he
had
been
tracked
and
followed
to
his
home
the
property
has
been
returned
to
mr
grinling
the
rightful
owner
concluded
this
letter
and
he
has
decided
not
to
prosecute
you
for
your
wifes
sake
so
long
as
you
keep
clear
of
dishonest
doings
in
the
future
mr
davison
was
very
much
astonished
to
recover
his
property
so
quickly
especially
as
we
gave
him
no
clue
to
the
thief
or
a
hint
of
our
modus
operandi
we
only
advised
him
to
remove
his
pawnbroking
business
to
safer
premises
it
does
not
do
for
private
detectives
to
let
their
clients
know
how
simple
their
business
can
be
on
occasion
ii
hoist
on
her
own
petard
we
were
morally
certain
that
madame
rose
gringoire
was
no
other
than
the
fraulein
bertha
gerhardt
whom
we
had
been
patiently
seeking
for
six
months
but
moral
certainty
is
a
long
way
removed
from
proof
positive
and
the
client
who
was
employing
us
was
slow
to
believe
that
we
had
almost
cornered
our
quarry
you
see
the
circumstances
were
not
merely
peculiar
they
were
of
desperate
moment
and
upon
the
circumvention
of
bertha
gerhardts
intrigues
depended
either
the
reputation
or
the
fortune
of
a
family
which
had
by
virtue
of
its
wealth
and
spotless
lineage
made
itself
a
power
in
its
residential
county
sir
arthur
and
lady
brackett
were
desperately
anxious
to
recover
some
papers
which
the
whilom
governess
had
abstracted
from
a
secret
drawer
in
which
they
were
believed
to
be
in
absolutely
safe
keeping
of
the
precise
nature
of
these
documents
professional
honour
forbids
me
to
speak
equally
momentous
secrets
are
often
confided
to
us
and
the
many
cases
of
a
delicate
nature
with
which
our
firm
are
entrusted
are
the
outcome
of
a
steadily
growing
reputation
for
discretion
and
reliability
were
blackmailing
our
forte
we
might
wax
rich
on
our
knowledge
of
the
strange
events
and
conditions
which
harass
the
lives
and
endanger
the
prosperity
of
the
apparently
rich
and
happy
to
the
latter
class
belonged
sir
arthur
and
lady
brackett
and
we
were
the
more
anxious
to
bring
their
case
to
a
satisfactory
issue
because
we
knew
that
the
somewhat
disreputable
family
doings
in
which
this
trouble
originated
were
condemned
by
them
at
the
time
and
were
beyond
their
power
to
prevent
how
bertha
gerhardt
obtained
her
knowledge
of
the
skeleton
in
their
cupboard
is
still
a
mystery
but
it
is
believed
that
sir
arthurs
scapegrace
brother
who
hated
his
fathers
heir
with
a
hatred
which
could
hardly
be
equalled
by
men
of
alien
races
had
made
a
confidant
of
her
and
that
she
had
sought
the
post
of
governess
as
a
means
of
securing
the
incriminating
documents
have
you
a
photograph
of
fraulein
gerhardt
inquired
mr
bell
before
whom
sir
arthur
had
just
laid
his
case
yes
we
have
a
small
one
though
the
original
does
not
know
was
the
reply
my
wife
is
very
fond
of
amateur
photography
and
has
photographed
nearly
every
nook
and
cranny
of
the
house
and
estate
miss
gerhardt
is
not
handsome
and
she
always
laughingly
refused
to
have
her
plainness
perpetuated
on
paper
one
morning
lady
brackett
had
had
her
camera
taken
into
the
drawingroom
and
had
embraced
the
governess
within
its
scope
ere
that
lady
was
aware
of
her
intention
when
she
discovered
she
had
been
photographed
she
with
difficulty
kept
back
the
signs
of
her
anger
and
it
was
rather
odd
that
the
negative
of
the
little
picture
should
have
been
found
broken
a
day
or
two
later
but
though
miss
gerhardt
was
not
made
aware
of
the
fact
two
or
three
prints
had
been
taken
before
the
negative
was
destroyed
and
from
one
of
these
we
have
enlarged
her
photograph
here
is
a
copy
it
is
not
very
good
but
will
no
doubt
be
useful
excellent
sir
arthur
it
is
evidently
a
good
likeness
and
will
suit
us
even
better
than
one
which
has
been
toned
down
and
touched
up
by
a
professional
photographer
for
the
sake
of
flattering
a
customer
it
is
quite
apparent
that
this
clever
lady
meant
to
take
every
precaution
against
being
overreached
she
will
be
astonished
when
we
run
her
to
earth
i
hope
you
will
manage
that
feat
i
do
not
think
there
is
much
doubt
on
the
subject
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
time
and
meanwhile
my
fortune
is
being
drained
we
will
be
as
expeditious
as
possible
you
say
that
miss
gerhardt
must
not
be
arrested
by
no
means
everything
depends
upon
strict
secrecy
were
this
not
the
case
we
would
not
have
parted
so
readily
with
the
money
which
has
been
demanded
of
us
from
time
to
time
and
you
have
no
idea
where
this
woman
resides
since
she
quitted
brackett
hall
not
the
slightest
we
were
surprised
and
mystified
at
her
sudden
departure
but
did
not
suspect
her
of
any
covert
act
until
she
wrote
to
us
her
letter
was
an
impudent
avowal
of
her
abstraction
of
the
papers
upon
which
our
destiny
hangs
and
she
demanded
a
large
amount
of
money
as
the
price
of
her
silence
since
then
we
have
had
several
letters
from
her
but
both
her
letters
and
our
remittances
all
pass
through
the
hands
of
a
shady
solicitor
who
lives
in
a
short
street
off
the
strand
and
who
will
give
us
no
clue
to
his
clients
whereabouts
mr
white
elicited
several
more
particulars
from
the
troubled
baronet
and
then
set
about
performing
the
mission
entrusted
to
him
the
fact
that
miss
gerhardt
transacted
all
her
business
through
a
london
agent
made
it
seem
probable
that
she
herself
resided
in
london
and
for
several
weeks
we
kept
a
strict
watch
upon
the
lawyers
premises
but
without
result
the
lady
evidently
knew
better
than
to
show
herself
in
that
quarter
and
we
might
have
failed
to
rescue
our
client
from
his
insatiate
blackmailer
had
not
a
very
unforeseen
occurrence
taken
place
when
thieves
fall
out
honest
men
get
their
own
and
this
was
a
case
in
point
one
hot
july
afternoon
a
lady
came
to
our
office
to
invoke
our
aid
in
bringing
back
to
her
an
individual
who
had
absconded
with
a
large
sum
of
money
belonging
to
her
the
gentleman
she
described
and
named
was
hulbert
brackett
sir
arthur
bracketts
neerdoweel
younger
brother
and
our
wouldbe
new
client
bore
such
a
strong
resemblance
to
the
photograph
of
bertha
gerhardt
that
we
believed
this
to
be
that
lady
herself
but
she
gave
the
name
of
madame
rose
gringoire
and
professed
to
be
a
french
widow
who
had
entrusted
mr
brackett
with
all
her
fortune
to
invest
for
her
and
the
onus
of
proof
of
her
identity
with
the
german
schemer
whom
we
were
seeking
rested
with
us
she
certainly
spoke
and
comported
herself
as
frenchified
as
if
to
the
manner
born
but
we
soon
discovered
that
she
understood
german
equally
well
mr
henniker
got
up
in
very
teutonic
fashion
called
in
to
the
office
and
bungled
so
much
in
his
efforts
to
pass
himself
off
as
a
needy
german
who
couldnt
speak
english
that
madame
was
highly
amused
and
i
who
was
an
unsuspected
witness
of
the
scene
was
an
unsuspected
witness
of
the
scene
could
see
that
she
understood
every
word
that
was
said
this
discovery
helped
to
convince
us
that
we
were
indeed
on
the
right
track
even
if
the
sum
of
which
this
adventuress
complained
of
having
been
robbed
had
not
tallied
exactly
with
the
amount
extorted
from
sir
arthur
only
a
week
before
her
visit
to
us
i
am
afraid
the
thief
has
too
great
a
start
but
we
will
do
all
we
can
in
the
matter
said
mr
bell
i
hope
your
entire
resources
are
not
exhausted
by
no
means
i
can
always
get
more
money
where
that
came
from
but
i
have
no
mind
to
be
such
a
heavy
loser
all
the
same
then
you
will
pardon
me
i
hope
if
i
inquire
whether
you
would
care
to
have
the
matter
made
public
or
not
most
of
our
clients
prefer
us
to
conduct
all
their
affairs
with
the
utmost
secrecy
and
so
do
i
on
no
account
must
anyone
else
know
of
this
business
if
you
can
find
hulbert
brackett
for
me
i
can
soon
bring
him
to
terms
again
the
next
day
our
firm
received
a
note
from
madame
gringoire
stating
that
she
was
too
ill
to
keep
an
appointment
she
had
made
to
call
again
at
the
office
and
asking
us
to
let
her
know
at
once
if
we
heard
anything
about
her
absconding
friend
who
was
we
afterwards
discovered
actually
married
to
her
that
note
proved
very
useful
to
us
as
we
were
anxious
to
call
at
her
house
and
the
usually
so
ultracautious
woman
had
given
her
present
address
upon
it
she
had
been
followed
home
the
night
before
and
we
knew
her
address
already
but
having
received
it
from
herself
in
the
way
of
business
simplified
matters
for
us
that
afternoon
armed
with
an
introduction
from
our
firm
i
called
upon
madame
gringoire
i
found
her
suffering
from
a
bilious
headache
and
she
was
none
too
pleased
to
see
me
how
did
you
know
where
to
find
me
she
asked
suspiciously
why
madame
i
exclaimed
in
deprecative
surprise
you
gave
us
your
address
in
the
note
you
sent
this
morning
and
as
we
have
already
traced
your
fugitive
from
london
to
liverpool
we
thought
it
better
to
consult
you
at
once
about
him
as
we
did
not
know
what
further
course
to
take
without
definite
instructions
from
you
in
an
instant
madame
was
all
eagerness
and
attention
and
i
was
so
well
armed
with
details
thanks
to
sir
arthurs
circumstantial
explanations
that
i
succeeded
in
convincing
her
of
the
plausibility
of
my
story
henceforth
all
was
plain
sailing
the
next
atlantic
liner
would
leave
liverpool
in
two
days
there
was
time
for
madame
to
overtake
the
fugitive
or
rather
it
suited
us
to
persuade
her
that
such
was
the
case
it
was
arranged
that
on
the
following
morning
at
nine
oclock
madame
was
to
be
at
our
office
ready
to
start
at
once
with
mr
bell
and
myself
to
liverpool
we
were
to
be
paid
for
our
services
out
of
the
money
recovered
from
the
absconding
accomplice
the
lady
was
all
excitement
and
rang
the
bell
violently
for
her
maid
bring
some
tea
upstairs
she
commanded
and
set
about
packing
my
things
i
am
going
to
liverpool
in
the
morning
with
this
lady
and
will
be
away
a
few
days
with
that
headache
no
you
stupid
not
with
that
headache
i
am
going
to
leave
the
headache
at
home
for
you
to
take
care
of
while
i
am
away
now
go
on
with
your
work
the
next
morning
at
a
quarter
past
nine
while
madame
was
in
our
office
i
presented
myself
at
her
house
in
a
great
state
of
fluster
your
mistress
has
forgotten
some
papers
which
she
must
have
with
her
she
has
other
business
to
do
and
has
no
time
to
come
back
for
them
here
is
a
note
from
her
be
as
quick
as
you
can
please
such
was
the
message
to
sophie
and
she
never
doubted
my
bonafides
seeing
that
i
was
armed
with
a
letter
apparently
in
her
mistresss
handwriting
authorising
me
to
hunt
for
a
packet
of
papers
of
which
the
appearance
was
accurately
described
sophie
had
seen
her
mistress
looking
at
such
a
packet
as
was
described
and
at
once
took
me
to
the
bureau
in
which
they
were
kept
oddly
enough
i
had
forgotten
to
bring
the
key
with
me
and
there
was
no
time
to
go
back
for
it
so
rather
to
sophies
horror
i
broke
the
drawer
lock
open
then
having
found
the
great
prize
i
sought
i
hurried
to
the
street
jumped
into
the
hansom
waiting
for
me
and
was
soon
in
the
presence
of
the
lady
whose
schemes
i
had
circumvented
she
was
already
impatient
at
the
long
delay
and
started
up
in
alarm
when
she
saw
me
enter
the
office
smiling
triumphantly
and
holding
in
my
hands
the
papers
upon
which
hung
the
destiny
of
the
bracketts
she
sprang
forward
and
would
have
snatched
them
out
of
my
hand
but
i
was
too
quick
for
her
i
was
also
protected
by
my
colleagues
and
sir
arthur
who
had
been
telegraphed
for
arrived
at
the
same
moment
for
awhile
the
baffled
woman
shrieked
out
rage
and
threats
and
swore
that
all
the
world
should
know
the
disreputable
secret
connected
with
sir
arthurs
parents
but
the
latter
had
now
the
upper
hand
and
meant
to
keep
it
taking
the
packet
from
my
hand
and
opening
it
to
see
that
all
the
papers
were
there
he
promptly
threw
it
into
the
empty
fireplace
set
a
match
to
it
and
watched
it
burn
to
the
last
atom
you
have
filched
ten
thousand
pounds
out
of
me
because
i
dreaded
to
have
my
family
name
disgraced
you
will
get
no
more
every
proof
of
these
past
events
is
now
destroyed
and
any
assertions
you
might
make
would
not
be
believed
i
saw
the
man
who
claims
to
be
my
brother
last
night
he
tells
me
that
he
is
married
to
you
you
will
find
him
in
our
village
if
you
want
him
but
he
understands
as
fully
as
you
must
do
that
any
further
injury
he
may
attempt
to
do
me
will
recoil
on
his
own
head
mrs
hulbert
brackett
seemed
to
comprehend
the
situation
thoroughly
she
left
the
office
without
another
word
and
we
have
never
heard
of
her
since
iii
one
of
doras
failures
is
it
usual
to
record
ones
failures
i
believe
not
and
yet
many
of
them
are
perforce
as
interesting
to
the
public
as
ones
most
brilliant
successes
here
is
a
case
in
point
a
young
lady
whom
we
will
call
ada
calmour
had
had
the
misfortune
to
displease
her
wealthy
father
to
so
great
an
extent
that
he
vowed
never
to
forgive
her
her
crime
was
a
common
one
she
loved
a
handsome
young
fellow
who
was
impulsive
unlucky
poor
and
a
cousin
to
boot
and
steadfastly
declined
to
give
him
up
when
ordered
to
do
so
by
her
father
from
whom
bytheby
she
inherited
the
selfwill
which
roused
his
ire
just
about
this
time
mr
calmour
fell
under
the
spell
of
a
lady
whom
his
daughter
did
not
hesitate
to
dub
an
adventuress
of
the
most
pronounced
type
and
it
became
evident
to
his
friends
that
he
was
sickening
for
matrimony
the
ordinary
judge
of
humanity
would
have
imagined
that
mr
calmours
own
infatuation
would
have
made
him
more
tolerant
of
his
daughters
love
affair
but
to
the
tell
the
truth
he
was
perversity
personified
and
as
his
appreciation
of
miss
reedes
insidious
advances
increased
so
did
his
depreciation
of
his
nephews
qualities
progress
in
inverse
ratio
at
last
matters
reached
a
crisis
the
adventuresss
intrigues
progressed
successfully
and
miss
reede
succeeded
in
transforming
her
impecunious
self
into
the
wife
of
a
wealthy
country
magnate
she
had
evidently
entered
upon
her
new
sphere
of
life
with
fixed
ideas
as
to
the
fitness
of
things
for
she
had
no
sooner
returned
from
her
short
honeymoon
that
she
began
to
turn
the
house
upside
down
and
coolly
informed
her
stepdaughter
that
she
must
vacate
the
bedroom
she
had
always
occupied
as
it
was
to
be
transformed
into
a
boudoir
for
the
new
mistress
of
the
establishment
as
there
were
at
least
two
other
rooms
in
the
rambling
old
house
that
would
have
suited
mrs
calmours
purpose
equally
well
ada
recognised
in
the
new
arrangement
a
deliberate
intention
to
insult
her
and
suspected
that
the
ulterior
motive
was
to
drive
her
from
the
house
a
girl
of
meek
and
yielding
spirit
would
have
submitted
to
the
indignity
without
audible
complaint
miss
calmour
was
too
highspirited
for
that
and
declined
to
yield
her
treasured
privileges
without
a
struggle
her
father
had
always
petted
and
indulged
her
until
these
unfortunate
love
differences
arose
he
had
in
her
opinion
shown
strong
signs
of
mental
aberration
in
marrying
a
woman
of
whose
antecedents
he
knew
nothing
beyond
the
fact
that
she
owed
money
in
all
directions
before
she
secured
him
for
her
husband
and
that
her
very
close
intimacy
with
a
man
whom
she
represented
to
be
her
guardian
provoked
invidious
comments
ada
was
therefore
not
greatly
surprised
when
her
father
declined
to
put
a
veto
upon
mrs
calmours
appropriation
of
her
pet
sanctum
i
cant
see
that
there
is
anything
worth
making
a
fuss
about
he
observed
carelessly
if
the
room
is
wanted
you
can
easily
find
another
that
will
be
just
as
comfortable
in
fact
he
dismissed
the
matter
as
too
trivial
to
worry
about
the
mischief
lay
deeper
than
he
either
knew
or
cared
and
one
encroachment
followed
another
until
the
daughter
of
the
house
decided
that
her
room
was
preferable
to
her
company
the
immediate
result
of
this
conviction
was
action
on
her
part
she
quitted
the
home
she
idolised
and
it
was
surmised
by
her
father
and
his
wife
that
she
had
eloped
with
pearce
churchill
mrs
calmour
did
her
best
to
encourage
this
supposition
and
to
fan
the
already
unreasonable
anger
of
the
man
whose
money
she
coveted
for
herself
her
schemes
prospered
to
perfection
mr
calmour
swore
never
to
look
upon
his
daughter
again
or
to
allow
her
to
touch
a
farthing
of
his
money
her
goodfornothing
husband
may
keep
her
he
observed
callously
she
didnt
know
when
she
was
well
off
and
as
she
has
chosen
to
make
her
own
bed
she
may
lie
upon
it
but
the
poor
girl
had
not
married
her
cousin
after
all
although
he
was
eager
that
she
should
become
his
wife
even
though
the
fortune
she
once
expected
to
inherit
was
probably
alienated
from
her
for
ever
when
ada
discovered
that
her
lovers
income
was
totally
inadequate
for
even
one
she
declined
to
add
to
his
responsibilities
and
went
into
the
world
to
earn
her
own
living
and
you
must
not
write
to
me
for
twelve
months
she
said
firmly
but
tearfully
i
love
you
dearly
pearce
but
you
shall
not
sacrifice
yourself
to
a
penniless
wife
until
time
and
absence
have
tested
your
affection
you
need
not
fear
for
me
i
shall
get
on
well
enough
and
in
twelve
months
i
will
write
to
you
and
will
gladly
marry
you
if
you
still
want
me
all
pearce
churchills
arguments
in
favour
of
an
immediate
marriage
were
in
vain
and
when
mr
calmour
died
quite
suddenly
three
months
after
his
daughters
disappearance
none
knew
where
to
find
her
probably
the
misguided
man
had
been
visited
by
compunctious
qualms
of
conscience
concerning
his
treatment
of
his
own
child
for
his
will
as
read
at
the
funeral
savoured
of
a
halfhearted
attempt
to
saddle
fate
with
the
responsibility
of
deciding
whether
his
wife
or
his
daughter
should
inherit
his
wealth
said
will
was
fantastic
to
a
ridiculous
degree
and
provoked
the
indignation
of
all
the
old
friends
of
the
family
who
estimated
mrs
calmour
at
her
true
value
and
set
her
down
as
the
unscrupulous
scheming
adventuress
she
really
was
some
even
went
so
far
as
to
hint
that
mr
calmour
who
was
in
the
prime
of
life
and
had
always
been
a
healthy
man
would
have
been
alive
still
if
he
had
been
further
removed
from
his
wifes
influence
but
hints
and
suspicions
are
more
easily
indulged
in
than
open
accusations
and
many
a
tragedy
remains
unexposed
because
nobody
likes
to
be
the
initiative
accuser
thus
though
many
black
glances
were
levelled
at
the
newly
made
widow
she
was
allowed
to
pursue
the
even
tenor
of
her
way
unmolested
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
her
badly
disguised
rage
at
the
gist
of
her
husbands
will
increased
the
distrust
with
which
she
was
already
regarded
mr
calmour
had
been
enlightened
as
to
the
true
state
of
affairs
with
regard
to
his
daughter
at
least
as
far
as
his
nephew
could
enlighten
him
and
had
become
aware
that
she
was
struggling
unaided
to
earn
a
livelihood
which
he
could
have
given
her
without
missing
the
money
i
am
very
anxious
about
ada
pearce
had
written
i
have
written
to
the
last
address
i
had
and
my
letters
have
been
returned
marked
not
known
i
have
now
got
a
good
appointment
and
could
i
but
find
her
ada
would
marry
me
at
once
she
only
refused
me
before
because
she
was
afraid
of
making
me
still
poorer
than
i
was
she
is
a
noble
girl
and
has
been
shamefully
treated
on
your
head
be
it
if
she
has
come
to
grief
in
her
fight
with
adversity
i
wonder
what
my
aunt
whom
you
used
to
pretend
to
love
would
think
if
she
could
know
that
within
two
years
of
her
death
you
have
practically
turned
her
only
child
into
the
streets
to
make
room
for
a
professional
adventuress
whom
no
one
but
you
would
have
married
pearce
churchill
knew
that
his
letter
would
enrage
his
uncle
but
he
also
hoped
that
it
might
have
a
salutary
effect
the
will
which
he
heard
read
convinced
him
that
his
hope
had
not
been
quite
in
vain
mr
calmour
left
all
his
property
subject
to
an
annuity
of
one
hundred
per
annum
for
his
wife
to
his
nephew
pearce
churchill
on
condition
that
he
was
married
to
ada
within
three
months
of
the
testators
death
should
this
marriage
not
take
place
within
the
stipulated
period
ada
and
pearce
were
to
have
one
hundred
per
annum
each
and
everything
else
was
to
go
to
his
wife
absolutely
no
less
than
five
thousand
a
year
being
involved
altogether
the
stake
was
so
big
and
it
seemed
so
monstrous
that
this
hated
interloper
should
succeed
to
the
estates
that
had
been
in
the
calmour
family
over
three
hundred
years
that
every
effort
was
made
to
baffle
her
we
were
speedily
commissioned
to
discover
ada
calmour
and
put
forth
all
our
energies
to
the
task
indeed
we
had
been
offered
such
a
large
sum
in
the
event
of
success
that
we
engaged
a
colleague
for
me
in
the
person
of
a
woman
of
thirty
or
thereabouts
who
came
to
us
with
very
good
credentials
one
of
these
we
verified
the
other
reference
had
just
started
on
a
continental
tour
when
mr
white
wrote
to
him
and
was
uncomeatable
but
mrs
deane
was
engaged
and
proved
herself
so
exceedingly
smart
that
our
firm
soon
congratulated
itself
on
having
secured
her
services
just
at
this
time
the
calmour
case
was
engrossing
the
greater
part
of
my
attention
we
had
advertised
very
freely
but
our
advertisements
met
with
no
response
and
as
one
week
after
another
passed
and
all
our
plans
for
discovering
miss
calmour
failed
we
grew
very
anxious
about
the
matter
the
case
was
so
exasperatingly
disappointing
too
several
times
we
believed
ourselves
to
be
on
the
eve
of
discovery
and
each
time
our
expected
triumph
turned
out
to
be
a
willothewisp
twice
i
journeyed
to
a
distant
town
feeling
confident
of
meeting
miss
calmour
each
time
she
had
disappeared
and
left
no
trace
behind
her
or
at
least
so
little
that
it
was
difficult
to
work
upon
three
times
mrs
deane
set
off
on
a
similar
errand
and
three
times
she
returned
with
failure
written
on
her
face
at
last
the
fateful
day
of
limitation
came
and
went
wherever
she
might
be
now
adas
inheritance
was
lost
to
her
and
the
adventuress
was
triumphant
possessor
of
the
coveted
acres
and
personalty
at
the
end
of
twelve
months
probation
she
had
given
herself
miss
calmour
returned
and
then
we
managed
to
understand
the
cause
of
our
failure
she
had
been
engaged
as
travelling
companion
by
some
people
who
turned
out
to
have
been
in
the
pay
of
mrs
calmour
and
who
oddly
enough
were
the
people
who
had
been
given
as
reference
by
mrs
deane
all
newspapers
were
tabooed
by
miss
calmours
employers
a
mr
and
mrs
carlile
and
she
neither
knew
of
her
fathers
death
or
of
our
advertisements
the
carliles
were
very
erratic
travellers
and
it
subsequently
transpired
that
their
hurried
departures
had
been
coincidental
with
the
futile
journeys
of
myself
or
my
lady
colleague
they
had
in
fact
been
warned
of
our
intended
arrival
and
had
always
managed
to
carry
their
unsuspecting
companion
away
in
time
to
avoid
discovery
miss
calmour
bitterly
regretted
having
insisted
upon
twelve
months
probation
for
although
she
was
soon
very
happily
married
to
her
cousin
and
although
his
earnings
and
their
joint
little
incomes
brought
in
a
total
of
six
hundred
a
year
this
was
very
far
short
of
what
would
have
been
theirs
had
they
inherited
under
mr
calmours
stupid
and
eccentric
will
they
did
not
doubt
that
mrs
calmour
learnt
somehow
that
we
were
employed
to
trace
the
heiress
and
had
counterschemed
to
prevent
the
discovery
we
were
so
anxious
to
make
a
few
months
after
this
painful
failure
of
ours
i
was
in
the
neighbourhood
of
calmour
grange
and
saw
the
lady
of
the
house
driven
past
me
in
great
style
i
was
naturally
curious
as
to
her
personality
and
am
not
sure
that
i
was
quite
as
surprised
as
i
might
have
been
at
the
discovery
i
made
i
knew
now
that
success
would
have
been
will
nigh
impossible
for
me
mrs
calmour
was
no
other
than
mrs
deane
the
clever
lady
detective
who
stayed
in
our
employment
three
months
and
to
whom
we
confided
all
the
details
about
the
great
will
case
i
have
another
story
to
relate
about
her
iv
dora
turns
the
tables
there
will
soon
be
very
little
of
my
uncle
calmours
property
left
if
this
woman
is
allowed
to
pursue
her
present
reckless
course
of
extravagance
observed
mr
churchill
discontentedly
about
two
years
after
the
incidents
narrated
in
the
last
story
he
had
come
to
consult
me
as
to
the
possibility
of
still
outwitting
mrs
calmour
and
of
regaining
possession
of
the
family
acres
he
had
but
the
haziest
idea
as
to
the
plan
most
likely
to
realise
his
wishes
and
admitted
that
the
widows
position
seemed
unassailable
from
an
ordinary
point
of
view
yet
in
spite
of
our
previous
failure
he
was
imbued
with
such
an
extravagant
belief
in
the
abnormal
ability
of
messrs
bell
and
white
that
he
had
taken
it
into
his
head
to
see
if
we
could
not
unseat
the
adventuress
even
now
according
to
the
law
of
england
i
observed
to
mr
churchill
mrs
calmour
is
perfectly
entitled
to
squander
the
property
the
will
has
been
duly
proved
and
unless
we
could
show
that
this
clever
schemers
title
is
base
there
is
little
chance
of
ousting
her
what
are
the
pleas
upon
which
we
could
upset
her
right
to
possession
probably
a
clever
lawyer
if
you
could
find
such
an
individual
might
suggest
several
at
present
i
can
only
think
of
two
and
they
are
the
illegality
of
mr
calmours
marriage
and
the
existence
of
a
will
posterior
to
the
one
that
has
been
proved
miss
bell
you
give
me
new
hope
there
may
really
be
another
will
in
existence
or
rather
there
may
have
been
when
i
come
to
think
of
it
it
is
not
likely
that
such
a
will
would
have
been
kept
so
long
even
if
it
had
ever
been
penned
to
suppress
a
will
is
a
serious
thing
and
culprits
do
not
i
should
imagine
carefully
preserve
the
evidence
of
their
own
guilt
there
you
are
quite
wrong
there
are
innumerable
instances
on
record
of
people
who
have
been
punished
for
grave
crimes
that
would
never
have
been
brought
home
to
them
but
for
their
own
incredible
carelessness
a
letter
an
article
of
wearing
apparel
a
trivial
trinket
–
these
have
often
been
the
principal
factors
in
elucidating
criminal
puzzles
then
you
really
think
mrs
calmour
has
kept
the
real
will
back
my
dear
sir
i
never
said
any
such
thing
i
only
supposed
it
possible
that
to
secure
the
property
mrs
calmour
had
suppressed
her
husbands
final
testament
in
which
case
it
might
safely
be
concluded
that
it
would
have
been
entirely
in
your
or
your
wifes
favour
since
the
will
that
was
eventually
proved
required
a
lot
of
very
clever
scheming
on
the
successful
legatees
part
just
so
and
i
mean
to
act
on
the
supposition
that
you
have
made
a
correct
guess
at
the
true
state
of
affairs
the
idea
that
the
marriage
was
not
legal
cannot
be
entertained
for
a
moment
there
are
too
many
proofs
to
the
contrary
worse
luck
so
you
think
but
we
are
accustomed
to
look
at
a
case
from
every
point
of
view
an
exhaustive
analysis
of
mrs
calmours
past
might
disclose
the
existence
of
a
prior
right
on
the
part
of
some
accommodating
individual
who
is
content
to
remain
in
the
background
for
the
sake
of
a
liberal
share
of
the
plunder
but
this
view
of
the
case
excited
my
impulsive
client
so
much
that
i
with
difficulty
restrained
his
prematurely
triumphant
exultation
and
when
he
left
our
office
he
seemed
to
be
firmly
convinced
that
his
wife
would
still
become
possessor
of
what
was
left
of
her
fathers
estate
as
she
was
an
only
child
it
had
always
been
natural
to
suppose
herself
the
heiress
and
as
at
first
one
beloved
piece
of
land
and
then
another
was
sold
by
the
present
possessor
she
found
it
very
hard
to
hear
of
such
wanton
waste
of
fine
property
probably
she
would
share
her
husbands
newlyawakened
hopes
and
enthusiasm
when
he
told
her
of
his
interview
with
me
and
were
these
hopes
quite
as
unfounded
as
they
appear
at
the
first
blush
probably
not
i
had
been
so
much
chagrined
at
the
manner
in
which
i
had
been
outwitted
by
mrs
calmour
that
i
had
resolved
to
ferret
well
into
her
past
life
and
rake
thence
such
items
of
interest
as
would
help
to
turn
the
tables
on
her
and
return
to
mrs
churchill
the
property
which
i
deemed
morally
hers
i
had
already
made
good
progress
in
my
researches
before
i
was
consulted
again
by
my
client
but
it
would
not
have
been
wise
from
a
professional
point
of
view
to
betray
the
full
extent
of
my
knowledge
at
once
clients
have
sometimes
a
rather
a
nasty
knack
of
imagining
that
the
remuneration
due
to
a
private
detective
is
commensurate
with
the
amount
of
research
required
after
a
case
has
been
actually
taken
in
hand
on
their
behalf
they
forget
that
all
the
knowledge
and
experience
which
is
anterior
to
their
application
for
their
assistance
has
been
the
result
of
determined
labour
and
forethought
without
which
no
detective
could
hope
to
succeed
and
which
deserve
ultimate
interest
equally
with
the
clients
own
provision
for
the
future
whether
it
be
in
the
shape
of
invested
funds
or
acquired
mental
knowledge
of
course
a
great
proportion
of
our
clients
are
of
a
more
reasonable
nature
but
the
exceptions
have
taught
us
caution
and
we
rarely
fall
into
a
confidential
mood
until
we
are
quite
sure
that
our
professional
prestige
will
not
suffer
by
doing
so
thus
it
happened
that
i
forebore
to
tell
mr
churchill
how
hopeful
i
really
considered
his
wifes
cause
to
be
but
i
knew
enough
already
to
have
made
mrs
calmour
quake
in
her
shoes
could
she
have
guessed
that
i
was
on
her
trail
for
instance
i
knew
that
a
certain
mr
selby
formerly
posed
as
the
guardian
of
the
lady
who
bytheby
was
at
least
thirtysix
years
of
age
though
she
only
owned
to
being
twentyseven
on
making
certain
inquiries
i
learned
something
else
about
mr
selby
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
his
doings
were
quite
as
shady
as
those
of
his
ward
he
made
it
a
practice
to
hunt
up
charming
country
cottages
or
handsomely
furnished
suites
of
rooms
and
to
offer
such
liberal
terms
for
them
as
tempted
their
owners
to
take
a
lodger
in
for
once
in
order
to
earn
an
extra
honest
penny
then
mr
selby
who
had
sung
the
praises
of
his
accomplice
skyhigh
would
superintend
the
installation
of
that
individual
with
much
empressement
the
lady
whom
he
always
represented
as
rich
and
whom
he
endowed
with
fictitious
relationship
to
people
of
note
who
would
have
repudiated
all
connection
with
her
would
bring
her
maid
and
her
bosom
female
crony
a
certain
miss
losteel
and
they
and
the
reputed
guardian
would
eat
and
drink
the
poor
hosts
into
ruination
this
would
last
until
the
latter
began
to
look
askance
at
the
idea
of
always
receiving
excuses
instead
of
money
and
then
the
gang
would
suddenly
seek
fresh
victims
oddly
enough
the
victimised
hosts
generally
found
that
some
of
their
treasured
knickknacks
always
disappeared
at
the
same
time
as
their
swindling
lady
lodger
who
while
the
spell
of
her
fascination
lasted
borrowed
money
for
stamps
stationery
railway
fares
and
any
other
thing
for
which
money
is
absolutely
needed
the
woman
was
short
squat
dark
and
of
curious
square
set
features
while
under
the
aegis
of
the
charm
which
she
could
use
at
will
people
found
all
sorts
of
excuses
for
her
constant
lapses
into
vulgarity
and
smiled
at
the
egregious
vanity
she
displayed
once
fully
alive
to
the
unscrupulous
creatures
real
nature
they
wondered
how
such
an
ugly
incarnation
of
selfishness
could
ever
have
fascinated
them
and
were
inclined
to
attribute
her
power
to
sorcery
or
hypnotism
or
to
anything
but
the
deeplaid
plots
of
mere
cunning
after
miss
reedes
marriage
to
mr
calmour
the
whilom
guardian
he
posed
as
uncle
at
dieppe
lived
in
bachelor
chambers
in
london
in
great
style
and
did
not
even
trouble
to
go
to
the
office
in
which
he
had
formerly
done
occasional
business
of
a
shady
sort
he
had
money
enough
to
live
upon
and
i
had
no
difficulty
in
surmising
whence
it
came
soon
after
mrs
calmour
succeeded
to
the
estates
mr
selby
developed
into
a
property
buyer
he
figured
at
several
of
the
purchases
of
land
sold
by
the
widow
as
the
latter
showed
no
signs
of
being
better
off
for
all
the
cash
she
got
i
inferred
that
it
found
its
way
back
into
mr
selbys
possession
and
that
the
latest
scheme
was
intended
to
divert
the
ownership
of
the
property
to
the
nominal
purchaser
instead
of
the
widow
i
argued
that
there
must
be
a
reason
for
this
and
the
painstaking
researches
i
made
resulted
in
the
astounding
discovery
that
the
couple
were
really
man
and
wife
they
had
found
it
pay
better
to
profess
a
different
relationship
the
marriage
with
mr
calmour
was
therefore
null
and
void
but
i
was
not
quite
sure
that
this
fact
would
suffice
to
restore
her
fortune
to
mrs
churchill
prolonged
observation
convinced
me
that
the
utmost
harmony
existed
between
the
two
conspirators
i
felt
sure
that
fear
of
discovery
was
prompting
the
transfer
of
the
property
and
argued
that
as
friendly
relations
existed
between
the
two
principals
there
must
be
a
third
party
of
whose
revelations
they
were
afraid
it
did
not
require
much
ingenuity
to
supply
the
missing
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
i
was
weaving
round
the
lady
who
had
outwitted
me
so
cleverly
when
posing
as
my
colleague
suppose
i
turned
my
attention
to
the
mr
and
mrs
carlile
whose
active
cooperation
ensured
the
success
of
the
widows
schemes
i
thought
the
plan
a
very
good
one
and
followed
it
up
with
such
success
that
i
learnt
enough
of
the
past
life
of
the
carliles
to
have
sent
them
both
to
penal
servitude
my
colleagues
had
given
me
their
active
cooperation
and
when
i
had
arrived
at
a
quite
triumphant
point
of
my
personal
investigations
i
knew
exactly
where
to
put
my
hands
on
the
people
i
wanted
but
i
did
not
care
to
present
myself
unsupported
in
the
lions
den
so
was
accompanied
both
by
my
uncle
and
by
mr
henniker
when
i
paid
the
unsuspecting
swindlers
a
visit
within
half
an
hour
we
convinced
them
that
we
had
them
in
our
power
and
that
the
only
way
to
escape
imprisonment
themselves
was
to
confess
everything
they
knew
relating
to
mr
calmours
inheritrix
and
her
accomplice
and
a
pretty
confession
it
was
too
it
seems
that
the
misguided
squire
had
made
two
wills
both
in
legal
form
and
both
drafted
without
the
assistance
of
a
lawyer
of
the
one
the
reader
has
heard
particulars
and
though
it
did
not
carry
out
mrs
calmours
own
views
she
preferred
to
risk
her
chances
on
it
rather
than
on
the
one
made
by
the
legatee
in
the
heat
of
passion
a
few
hours
before
he
died
this
last
will
left
everything
to
ada
calmour
absolutely
and
unconditionally
and
was
the
outcome
of
mr
calmours
discovery
that
he
had
been
duped
and
fooled
he
was
altogether
so
excited
at
this
revelation
that
he
was
visited
by
a
stroke
and
died
without
being
able
to
impart
his
knowledge
to
anyone
who
would
have
helped
to
see
justice
done
to
his
daughter
mrs
carlile
was
a
visitor
in
the
house
at
the
time
she
obtained
possession
of
mr
calmours
last
will
and
declined
to
give
it
up
when
asked
to
do
so
by
the
supposed
widow
as
she
was
quite
aware
of
the
power
its
possession
gave
her
the
carliles
had
lived
quite
luxuriously
at
mrs
calmours
expense
but
had
found
it
necessary
to
threaten
exposure
lately
as
they
had
become
suspicious
of
her
intention
to
realise
all
she
could
and
levant
with
her
lawful
husband
the
reader
can
guess
the
rest
mr
and
mrs
churchill
are
installed
in
their
own
again
even
the
land
nominally
sold
to
the
man
calling
himself
selby
is
restored
to
them
as
the
transfer
was
a
palpably
fraudulent
transaction
between
him
and
his
wife
who
had
no
legal
power
to
sell
the
carliles
have
deemed
it
wise
to
emigrate
i
wish
i
could
add
that
the
selbys
had
been
duly
punished
for
their
misdeeds
but
mrs
churchill
did
not
care
to
expose
her
poor
fathers
weakness
too
widely
and
has
let
them
go
scot
free
for
anything
i
know
to
the
contrary
they
have
reverted
to
their
former
farcical
pretence
of
being
a
guardian
of
his
rich
genius
of
a
ward
certain
it
is
that
wherever
they
are
they
are
swindling
somebody
and
i
would
earnestly
warn
my
readers
against
trusting
the
unsupported
testimony
of
a
plausible
gentlemanly
fellow
who
wants
to
engage
costly
board
and
lodgings
for
his
lady
friend
whom
he
endows
with
the
additional
recommendation
of
being
about
to
outstrip
her
pretended
talented
relations
in
the
race
for
fame
v
acquaintance
dodge
yes
it
was
undoubtedly
the
same
woman
i
had
seen
her
before
and
knew
her
to
be
of
very
equivocal
character
nay
i
will
go
a
step
further
and
assure
my
readers
that
she
was
a
person
of
very
disreputable
antecedents
and
had
recently
served
a
term
of
imprisonment
in
consequence
of
certain
disclosures
for
which
our
firm
was
responsible
her
penchant
for
frequent
changes
of
names
made
it
difficult
to
follow
her
career
but
the
last
name
under
which
i
had
known
her
was
angelina
dyer
and
as
angelina
dyer
she
was
convicted
of
assisting
at
the
operations
of
a
gang
of
burglars
of
whom
i
have
an
exciting
story
to
tell
some
day
knowing
the
true
character
of
this
woman
therefore
it
caused
me
no
small
surprise
to
see
her
talking
to
mr
lanimore
one
of
our
city
aldermen
whom
i
would
have
deemed
one
of
the
last
individuals
in
the
world
to
have
dealings
with
angelina
dyer
my
curiosity
was
aroused
i
determined
to
see
the
farce
to
the
end
and
for
the
present
relinquished
my
intention
of
taking
a
hansom
to
liverpoolstreet
station
whither
i
was
bent
on
a
mission
that
could
easily
wait
for
another
opportunity
angelina
was
naturally
rather
handsome
and
on
the
present
occasion
was
dressed
with
such
remarkably
good
taste
that
the
casual
onlooker
might
easily
mistake
her
for
the
lady
she
was
evidently
pretending
to
be
her
face
wore
an
expression
of
pleased
surprise
and
she
held
out
her
hand
with
a
warmth
of
welcome
which
there
was
no
resisting
there
was
a
handshake
very
cordial
on
the
one
side
somewhat
hesitating
on
the
other
and
then
i
knew
what
was
going
on
just
as
well
as
if
i
had
been
within
earshot
alderman
lanimore
was
finding
it
difficult
to
recognise
his
impulsive
interlocutor
and
angelina
was
expressing
her
delight
at
meeting
such
an
old
friend
and
in
london
too
of
all
places
in
the
world
there
was
a
few
moments
smiling
repudiation
of
bygone
acquaintanceship
on
one
side
and
an
apparently
regretful
realisation
of
the
truth
on
the
other
and
then
the
little
comedy
ended
the
lady
bowing
ceremoniously
and
the
gentleman
raising
his
hat
politely
a
second
later
angelina
had
vanished
in
the
neverending
crowd
which
makes
the
neighbourhood
of
the
mansion
house
one
of
the
typical
sights
of
london
mrs
dyers
abrupt
departure
did
not
trouble
me
i
knew
where
to
find
her
if
i
wanted
her
again
and
i
also
knew
that
there
would
be
a
further
development
of
this
seemingly
trivial
adventure
for
that
the
lady
with
the
angelic
name
had
had
an
ulterior
motive
in
accosting
the
alderman
i
was
certain
nor
was
my
conviction
long
in
being
verified
mr
lanimore
followed
by
myself
walked
along
cheapside
with
a
goodnatured
smile
on
his
face
until
he
reached
sir
william
bennets
famous
horological
establishment
then
it
struck
him
that
he
had
better
compare
his
timepiece
with
the
big
clock
over
the
shop
and
he
mechanically
put
his
hand
to
his
fob
to
withdraw
his
costly
gold
repeater
it
was
gone
i
could
almost
have
laughed
aloud
at
this
development
of
my
little
comedy
for
though
i
had
not
been
quite
sure
what
form
angelinas
cunning
would
take
and
although
in
spite
of
my
keen
watch
i
had
not
seen
her
take
anything
i
had
no
doubt
that
pocketpicking
was
the
ladys
real
game
nor
did
the
aldermans
next
act
surprise
me
he
hailed
an
empty
passing
hansom
and
almost
shouted
to
the
driver
bell
and
white
holborn
and
drive
like
wildfire
that
he
would
invoke
our
aid
had
also
been
one
of
my
foregone
conclusions
for
we
had
already
transacted
business
for
him
in
connection
with
the
large
firm
of
which
he
was
the
senior
partner
feeling
glad
that
mr
lanimore
had
not
seen
me
i
waited
until
another
hansom
had
appeared
and
then
gave
the
driver
a
somewhat
similar
order
to
the
one
given
by
the
alderman
a
few
moments
before
arrived
at
our
office
i
found
that
the
impatient
victim
of
the
auld
acquaintance
dodge
had
been
waiting
a
few
minutes
for
an
audience
with
one
of
the
principals
mr
jones
conducted
a
branch
business
now
and
was
seldom
at
the
london
office
mr
white
had
sold
out
and
retired
and
my
uncle
only
just
entered
the
office
as
i
did
leave
this
case
to
me
i
whispered
i
know
all
about
it
with
a
smile
and
a
nod
of
comprehension
mr
bell
betook
himself
to
his
own
private
sanctum
while
i
removed
my
outdoor
wraps
and
proceeded
to
interview
the
alderman
good
morning
mr
lanimore
what
can
we
do
for
you
this
time
oh
such
a
fool
as
i
have
been
miss
bell
actually
let
a
strange
woman
stop
me
in
the
street
and
talk
to
me
pretended
to
know
me
and
i
never
suspected
the
hussys
intentions
and
the
result
my
beautiful
gold
repeater
given
to
me
by
our
employees
when
i
was
elected
sheriff
has
disappeared
that
is
very
serious
serious
good
heavens
its
as
much
as
my
happiness
and
reputation
are
worth
to
lose
that
watch
i
must
have
it
back
and
the
affair
must
not
get
into
the
newspapers
i
suppose
not
publicity
is
not
always
desirable
in
this
case
it
would
be
ruination
the
circumstances
are
so
exasperating
my
partners
are
inclined
to
twit
me
about
what
they
call
my
starched
morality
my
rivals
in
the
council
chamber
are
on
the
lookout
for
a
chance
of
picking
a
hole
in
my
character
my
wife
is
desperately
and
absurdly
jealous
they
would
one
and
all
refuse
to
believe
that
i
did
not
know
to
whom
i
was
speaking
and
i
should
be
branded
as
a
hypocrite
who
practised
social
vices
under
the
cloak
of
pretended
morality
what
was
the
woman
like
tall
of
fine
figure
and
ladylike
appearance
with
bright
complexion
and
a
quantity
of
bright
golden
hair
she
also
wore
a
pair
of
gold
rimmed
eyeglasses
hm
not
much
to
go
by
there
are
so
many
stylishlooking
woman
with
yellow
hair
and
bright
complexions
nowadays
a
little
ready
money
and
a
determination
to
be
in
the
fashion
can
work
wonders
did
you
observe
any
other
peculiarity
about
the
pickpocket
no
nothing
you
see
i
had
not
time
to
notice
much
for
the
interview
was
short
and
i
was
quite
unsuspicious
well
there
is
very
little
to
act
upon
still
i
daresay
you
will
find
our
firm
of
more
use
than
the
police
would
have
been
i
am
quite
sure
of
it
those
other
cases
you
undertook
for
me
were
nothing
short
of
miraculous
and
i
have
the
utmost
faith
in
your
powers
thank
you
i
believe
i
may
almost
promise
that
you
shall
have
your
watch
back
within
a
week
meanwhile
say
nothing
about
the
affair
to
anyone
else
you
can
be
supposed
to
have
taken
your
repeater
to
be
regulated
when
mr
lanimore
left
our
office
he
was
much
more
at
ease
about
his
property
than
when
he
came
in
and
i
was
pretty
confident
about
my
ability
to
fulfil
my
apparently
rash
promise
i
had
taken
shorthand
notes
of
all
the
details
mr
lanimore
was
able
to
give
me
not
that
i
needed
them
but
it
looks
well
to
be
as
businesslike
as
possible
a
few
minutes
later
i
was
explaining
the
whole
affair
to
my
uncle
and
we
soon
had
our
plans
for
future
action
completed
we
generally
keep
an
eye
through
our
subordinates
on
such
likely
people
for
business
as
angelina
dyer
and
knew
that
she
was
lodging
in
a
street
off
commercialroad
at
this
moment
we
also
felt
sure
that
for
this
day
at
least
she
would
suspend
further
active
operations
in
the
city
at
present
she
would
be
displaying
her
prizes
to
the
admiring
gaze
of
her
associates
pawnshops
are
a
workedout
field
for
our
regular
watchlifters
they
have
a
safer
means
of
disposing
their
gains
not
far
from
houndsditch
there
lives
a
man
under
whose
clever
manipulative
fingers
stolen
watches
and
jewellery
lose
their
identity
if
ordinary
faking
wont
work
the
oracle
then
the
meltingpot
is
resorted
to
in
all
probability
alderman
lanimores
repeater
would
be
in
the
hands
of
the
watchfaker
within
twentyfour
hours
we
must
therefore
secure
it
tonight
–
if
not
by
strategy
then
by
force
four
subordinates
were
instantly
instructed
to
keep
a
careful
watch
upon
angelina
dyers
abode
and
to
set
about
the
business
without
delay
halfanhour
later
i
started
on
the
track
accompanied
by
adam
henniker
we
had
both
undergone
a
considerable
transformation
and
would
not
have
been
recognised
by
our
best
friends
we
looked
like
very
welltodo
country
simpletons
who
had
never
been
in
london
before
and
who
were
agog
with
amazement
at
all
we
saw
we
noticed
many
a
smile
of
covert
meaning
on
the
faces
of
passersby
whose
knowledge
of
the
neighbourhood
we
were
in
made
them
question
the
wisdom
of
our
gorgeously
liberal
display
of
jewellery
but
we
did
not
anticipate
trouble
as
our
colleagues
were
mostly
near
enough
to
assist
us
at
a
moments
notice
although
until
they
received
that
notice
we
were
as
utter
strangers
to
each
other
in
our
occasional
encounters
i
had
had
no
time
to
snatch
a
meal
before
setting
out
to
watch
for
angelina
again
and
was
feeling
very
hungry
but
dared
not
relax
my
attention
i
knew
however
that
people
of
the
class
we
had
chosen
to
represent
saw
no
breach
of
manners
in
eating
in
the
street
and
we
decided
that
our
assumption
of
the
roles
of
country
johnnies
would
look
much
more
natural
if
we
comported
ourselves
with
true
country
unconsciousness
when
therefore
angelina
realised
our
expectations
by
emerging
from
her
habitation
and
walking
towards
aldgate
adam
was
cutting
a
big
sandwich
with
a
huge
claspknife
and
i
was
making
futile
efforts
to
dispose
of
a
cake
that
had
proved
much
less
tempting
than
when
it
was
displayed
in
the
vendors
window
in
an
instant
angelina
spotted
prey
and
adam
with
his
mouth
halffull
of
sandwich
contrived
to
give
her
an
excuse
for
speaking
to
us
if
she
had
needed
one
remarking
loudly
aw
doant
care
jane
awm
not
gooin
whoam
withawt
seein
th
place
wheer

whitechapel
murders
were

con
yo

as
th

in
why
yes
was
the
smiling
reply
its
just
over
here
im
going
that
way
and
ill
show
you
the
street
five
minutes
later
the
business
was
accomplished
we
had
caught
the
pickpocket
in
flagrante
delicto
and
one
of
our
men
had
come
up
in
time
to
help
us
to
ease
her
of
the
watch
and
chain
she
had
just
stolen
from
adam
we
gave
her
the
alternative
of
going
to
prison
for
both
thefts
she
had
committed
that
day
or
of
purchasing
present
immunity
by
delivering
the
aldermans
gold
repeater
to
us
well
if
ever
i
let
a
set
of
lags
take
me
in
again
like
that
she
remarked
in
great
disgust
here
take
the
blooming
ticker
and
thank
your
stars
that
none
of
my
pals
are
about
when
alderman
lanimore
received
his
property
back
safe
and
sound
the
next
morning
he
could
not
restrain
his
admiration
of
our
astuteness
which
had
of
course
suppressed
disenchanting
explanations
wonderful
he
exclaimed
i
never
heard
tell
of
anything
like
it
your
deductions
and
methods
of
reasoning
must
be
more
than
human
wonderful
vi
a
broken
trust
i
am
sure
miss
bell
that
there
is
much
more
in
this
than
meets
the
eye
mrs
wemyssons
conduct
is
so
altogether
unexpected
and
inexplicable
that
it
can
only
be
accounted
for
on
the
hypothesis
of
some
peculiar
development
of
events
of
which
her
daughter
and
myself
are
supremely
ignorant
will
you
kindly
recapitulate
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
to
me
mr
wigan
certainly
you
see
miss
alice
wemysson
and
i
have
known
each
other
since
we
were
children
and
i
can
hardly
remember
the
time
when
i
did
not
dream
of
love
in
a
cottage
with
alice
yes
it
was
really
to
be
love
in
a
cottage
at
first
for
a
more
ambitious
prospect
did
not
disclose
itself
to
us
until
lately
my
father
has
too
many
claims
upon
his
purse
to
be
able
to
give
his
sons
more
towards
a
start
in
life
than
a
good
education
and
until
he
died
no
one
dreamed
that
mr
wemysson
possessed
more
than
a
modest
competence
the
attachment
between
alice
and
myself
was
so
patent
to
all
our
friends
that
our
names
have
been
coupled
together
for
years
but
no
formal
engagement
existed
between
us
and
though
mr
wemysson
seemed
to
be
rather
fond
of
me
than
otherwise
he
always
insisted
that
his
daughter
was
too
young
to
know
what
was
best
for
her
and
that
there
was
still
plenty
of
time
to
decide
her
future
things
were
in
this
position
when
mr
wemysson
died
and
then
it
transpired
that
he
was
a
comparatively
rich
man
having
left
ten
thousand
pounds
to
his
wife
and
ten
thousand
pounds
to
her
in
trust
for
alice
wemysson
who
was
the
daughter
of
the
testators
first
wife
the
young
lady
was
then
eighteen
and
she
was
to
be
under
the
absolute
guardianship
of
her
stepmother
until
she
was
twentyone
if
she
married
contrary
to
the
wishes
of
her
guardian
she
was
to
forfeit
her
inheritance
the
last
stipulation
afforded
nobody
any
uneasiness
for
everyone
knew
mrs
wemysson
to
be
well
disposed
towards
me
and
could
hardly
understand
why
such
a
condition
should
have
been
made
as
a
matter
of
fact
mrs
wemysson
gave
her
cordial
consent
to
the
engagement
soon
after
her
husbands
death
but
stipulated
for
the
postponement
of
the
marriage
until
the
bride
was
of
age
the
first
summer
after
this
unfortunate
event
passed
tranquilly
enough
as
winter
approached
my
motherinlawelect
developed
a
restless
disposition
which
culminated
in
a
determination
to
travel
and
see
the
world
my
means
have
always
been
too
cramped
to
permit
me
to
enjoy
life
properly
she
remarked
there
is
no
reason
however
why
i
should
make
myself
miserable
now
and
i
mean
to
get
all
the
pleasure
i
can
this
winter
alice
shall
do
the
continent
with
me
it
will
do
her
good
to
see
something
worth
seeing
before
she
settled
down
to
a
humdrum
married
life
to
tell
the
truth
both
alice
and
i
were
rather
shocked
at
this
speech
it
seemed
to
us
to
cast
a
reflection
on
the
good
man
whom
we
had
both
loved
and
implied
a
certain
feeling
of
elation
at
being
relieved
of
the
duties
and
ties
of
matrimony
which
illbefitted
a
woman
who
had
always
been
treated
with
affection
by
her
husband
but
no
serious
objections
to
the
proposed
trip
could
be
offered
and
the
day
came
when
i
bade
farewell
to
my
dear
girl
never
dreaming
that
aught
could
now
intervene
between
us
and
our
future
happiness
or
that
the
cloud
which
was
to
overshadow
our
destinies
was
already
rising
i
received
my
letters
regularly
alice
was
delighted
with
all
she
saw
and
gave
me
wonderful
descriptions
of
the
places
she
and
her
mother
visited
for
many
weeks
all
seemed
to
be
going
gaily
with
the
travellers
then
a
change
came
over
the
spirit
of
alices
letters
they
were
less
spontaneously
confidential
and
a
vague
sense
of
impending
trouble
seemed
to
pervade
them
but
i
could
get
no
satisfaction
until
the
travellers
returned
it
was
in
vain
that
i
questioned
my
questions
were
always
parried
evasively
and
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
i
was
surprised
when
my
darling
broke
down
at
sight
of
me
and
welcomed
me
with
tears
instead
of
smiles
i
had
been
waiting
a
long
time
at
the
station
for
them
my
impatience
leading
me
there
a
good
while
before
the
train
was
due
i
was
able
to
render
mrs
wemysson
some
little
services
but
could
not
help
seeing
that
my
attentions
were
unwelcome
and
when
i
saw
how
harassed
and
ill
alice
looked
i
was
filled
with
a
vague
foreboding
of
mischief
to
come
nor
was
my
foreboding
unfounded
during
the
course
of
that
same
evening
mrs
wemysson
informed
me
that
i
must
consider
my
engagement
with
her
daughter
at
an
end
as
she
had
other
views
for
her
in
fact
she
said
alice
is
going
to
marry
mr
jackson
a
gentleman
whom
we
met
abroad
probably
my
anger
got
the
better
of
my
good
manners
for
i
flatly
contradicted
the
widow
at
this
point
i
pointed
out
that
mr
wemysson
had
always
liked
me
that
she
herself
had
consented
to
our
engagement
and
that
i
knew
alice
to
be
true
as
steel
from
top
to
toe
nevertheless
she
will
not
marry
you
i
was
coolly
informed
she
knows
that
her
father
wished
her
to
obey
my
judgment
in
the
matter
and
she
is
too
good
a
daughter
to
act
counter
to
his
wishes
besides
if
she
were
to
marry
you
after
i
have
forbidden
her
to
do
so
she
would
forfeit
her
fortune
and
it
is
poor
love
that
would
reduce
its
object
to
poverty
now
alice
certainly
loved
her
father
very
much
but
she
is
not
exactly
a
girl
to
sacrifice
herself
without
knowing
the
reason
why
her
character
is
by
no
means
as
superficial
and
yielding
as
mrs
wemysson
imagines
and
she
vows
that
if
she
may
not
marry
me
she
will
marry
nobody
least
of
all
this
mr
jackson
who
is
elderly
thin
bald
waspishlooking
and
of
altogether
forbidding
exterior
his
face
is
also
so
indicative
of
craft
one
instinctively
distrusts
him
now
as
i
have
said
before
mrs
wemysson
must
have
some
powerful
motive
for
wishing
to
substitute
mr
jackson
for
myself
as
her
daughters
husband
and
i
want
you
to
unravel
the
mystery
for
me
i
had
listened
to
mr
wigans
story
with
some
interest
and
now
proceeded
to
crossquestion
him
who
or
what
is
this
mr
jackson
i
asked
he
is
a
solicitor
with
an
office
near
lincolns
inn
fields
how
long
has
mrs
wemysson
known
him
i
should
say
that
on
and
off
she
has
known
him
ten
years
he
was
the
late
mr
wemyssons
solicitor
but
was
never
on
visiting
terms
with
the
family
until
recently
where
did
he
meet
the
wemyssons
lately
at
monte
carlo
i
believe
the
widow
was
alarmingly
fond
of
the
gaming
tables
there
and
alice
suspects
that
she
lost
a
lot
of
money
is
mr
jackson
rich
on
the
contrary
he
barely
subsists
on
a
very
poor
business
then
what
was
he
doing
at
monte
carlo
he
had
to
go
over
there
on
business
for
another
client
–
to
watch
a
scapegrace
young
spendthrift
i
believe
while
there
he
recognised
mrs
wemysson
and
speedily
became
quite
familiar
the
widow
at
first
professed
to
dislike
him
very
much
but
apparently
got
over
her
dislike
and
entered
no
protest
when
he
proclaimed
himself
madly
in
love
with
her
ward
can
you
give
me
any
clue
to
this
mans
influence
over
the
widow
mr
wigan
not
the
slightest
i
only
know
that
the
influence
was
very
evident
and
that
although
mrs
wemyssons
temper
became
very
trying
towards
alice
she
submitted
very
quietly
to
a
somewhat
impertinent
reproof
from
mr
jackson
concerning
what
did
he
reprove
her
he
told
her
that
she
had
lost
quite
enough
at
the
tables
and
that
she
had
better
not
gamble
any
more
what
banker
do
the
wemyssons
patronise
the
national
and
provincial
bank
thank
you
i
believe
that
is
all
i
wish
to
ask
you
at
present
mr
wigan
i
will
look
into
the
case
and
let
you
know
the
results
as
soon
as
possible
when
my
client
departed
he
did
not
look
very
hopeful
of
the
results
of
my
investigations
and
although
my
plans
were
already
laid
i
was
not
at
all
sanguine
as
to
their
success
but
of
two
fundamental
facts
i
felt
certain
mrs
wemysson
had
committed
some
indiscretion
in
which
the
welfare
of
her
stepdaughter
was
involved
and
mr
jackson
was
not
only
cognisant
of
that
indiscretion
but
was
determined
to
make
capital
out
of
it
now
whatever
the
indiscretion
was
it
had
evidently
had
its
origin
at
monte
carlo
it
was
probably
connected
with
mrs
wemyssons
rashness
at
the
gaming
tables
but
at
this
point
the
puzzle
became
more
tangled
even
if
she
had
been
losing
money
heavily
this
would
not
make
marriage
into
her
family
desirable
for
an
impoverished
fortunehunter
for
that
mr
jackson
had
actually
fallen
in
love
with
alice
wemysson
was
i
concluded
hardly
a
likely
supposition
to
entertain
i
preferred
to
look
upon
his
motives
as
entirely
mercenary
suppose
miss
wemysson
proved
to
be
a
greater
matrimonial
prize
than
she
knew
herself
to
be
this
would
explain
the
solicitors
conduct
in
forcing
his
attentions
upon
an
unwilling
girl
but
it
made
the
widows
behaviour
all
the
more
inexplicable
with
a
view
of
satisfying
myself
as
to
miss
wemyssons
financial
position
i
communicated
with
one
of
the
employees
of
the
bank
in
which
her
father
had
invested
his
money
and
desired
him
to
let
me
know
how
much
of
this
money
had
been
withdrawn
we
make
a
point
of
having
friends
in
all
sorts
of
unlikely
places
and
their
cooperation
often
simplifies
our
work
wonderfully
in
this
case
the
information
i
got
startled
me
considerably
of
the
twenty
thousand
pounds
left
by
mr
wemysson
there
was
barely
five
thousand
left
mrs
wemysson
must
have
been
completely
carried
away
by
the
gambling
demon
to
risk
her
daughters
little
fortune
as
well
as
her
own
mr
jackson
evidently
knew
of
her
breach
of
trust
and
was
trading
upon
it
now
where
did
his
profit
come
in
i
determined
to
know
a
few
days
later
having
watched
him
leave
his
office
i
interviewed
the
poor
underpaid
soul
who
served
him
as
clerk
at
first
i
could
get
little
information
from
him
but
prompted
by
the
promise
of
another
situation
he
showed
me
what
a
scoundrel
his
employer
really
was
mr
jackson
knew
that
mrs
wemysson
had
gambled
her
daughters
money
and
threatened
to
expose
and
ruin
her
if
she
did
not
insist
upon
alice
marrying
him
he
forebore
to
tell
her
that
mr
wemyssons
brother
of
whom
they
had
not
heard
for
years
had
died
and
left
his
niece
a
fortune
of
fifty
thousand
pounds
he
as
the
family
solicitor
knew
all
about
it
but
was
keeping
the
information
back
until
he
had
secured
the
heiress
for
his
wife
my
course
was
now
plain
i
paid
a
visit
to
mrs
wemysson
and
proved
to
her
that
i
knew
more
about
her
own
and
her
daughters
affairs
than
she
did
she
was
very
humble
and
repentant
she
was
also
grateful
when
i
undertook
to
smooth
over
the
ruffled
feelings
of
the
injured
lovers
the
latter
are
now
happily
married
and
have
sealed
their
forgiveness
by
augmenting
mrs
wemyssons
fortune
to
its
original
amount
they
have
however
taken
the
precaution
to
place
only
the
interest
at
her
disposal
every
christmas
brings
me
some
wonderful
presents
from
mr
and
mrs
wigan
who
will
have
it
that
i
saved
them
from
lifelong
misery
by
exposing
mr
jacksons
schemes
ere
it
was
too
late
mr
jackson
himself
has
by
this
time
discovered
that
shady
ways
dont
pay
he
has
been
struck
off
the
rolls
and
lincolns
inn
fields
knows
him
no
more
vii
madame
duchesnes
garden
party
it
cost
more
than
two
hundred
pounds
miss
bell
but
that
is
not
the
worst
of
the
matter
my
aunt
stipulated
that
i
should
always
wear
it
as
a
perpetual
reminder
of
her
past
kindness
and
her
future
good
intentions
and
if
she
misses
it
i
shall
lose
favour
with
her
altogether
to
lose
miss
mainwarings
favour
means
to
lose
the
splendid
fortune
which
is
hers
to
bequeath
so
you
see
how
very
serious
the
matter
is
for
me
it
is
indeed
little
short
of
life
and
death
for
poverty
would
kill
me
now
for
gods
sake
do
your
best
for
me
but
surely
if
miss
mainwaring
knows
that
you
could
not
possibly
have
foreseen
your
loss
she
will
not
be
unjust
enough
to
disinherit
you
indeed
she
will
she
believes
me
to
be
vacillating
and
unreliable
because
i
broke
off
an
engagement
with
a
rich
man
to
whom
i
had
but
given
a
reluctant
acceptance
and
united
myself
to
the
man
of
my
choice
my
husband
was
poor
and
therefore
beyond
the
pale
of
forgiveness
and
my
own
pardon
is
only
based
on
the
most
unswerving
obedience
to
all
my
aunts
injunctions
the
pendant
came
from
india
and
the
stones
in
it
are
said
to
possess
occult
power
–
i
wish
they
had
the
power
to
come
back
to
their
rightful
owner
the
speaker
heaved
a
sigh
of
desperation
as
she
spoke
and
i
glanced
at
her
with
considerable
interest
she
was
tall
pale
darkeyed
and
handsome
but
her
appearance
bore
certain
signs
of
that
vacillation
and
carelessness
of
which
her
aunt
accredited
her
with
the
possession
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
loss
of
which
she
complained
were
peculiar
she
had
been
spending
the
evening
at
the
house
of
the
german
ambassador
and
was
returning
home
in
miss
mainwarings
carriage
when
she
became
aware
of
the
fact
that
she
had
lost
the
jewelled
pendant
which
her
aunt
had
given
her
as
a
token
of
reconciliation
when
she
returned
to
her
after
being
suddenly
widowed
a
frantic
search
of
the
carriage
bore
no
results
and
mrs
bevan
hastily
told
the
coachman
to
return
to
the
embassy
but
she
prudently
refrained
from
confiding
the
particulars
of
her
loss
to
him
for
she
was
not
quite
without
hope
that
it
might
be
remedied
madame
von
auerbach
was
however
able
to
give
her
no
comfort
for
she
had
herself
suffered
in
like
manner
with
her
guest
she
had
lost
a
valuable
diamondstudded
watch
and
when
the
most
careful
search
failed
to
discover
it
the
conclusion
arrived
at
was
that
some
thief
must
have
been
present
at
the
reception
it
was
an
unpleasant
conclusion
to
arrive
at
but
it
was
the
only
natural
one
for
the
ambassadors
wife
had
not
left
her
guests
or
gone
beyond
the
reception
rooms
from
the
time
she
entered
them
wearing
the
watch
to
the
moment
when
the
last
visitors
having
just
gone
she
thought
of
looking
at
her
watch
and
found
that
it
had
disappeared
mrs
bevans
return
a
few
moments
later
with
the
news
that
her
pendant
had
disappeared
confirmed
the
supposition
that
some
professional
thief
must
have
been
at
work
and
the
police
were
at
once
communicated
with
they
were
also
strictly
enjoined
to
keep
the
matter
a
profound
secret
for
various
reasons
but
mrs
bevan
was
too
anxious
to
rely
entirely
upon
the
exertions
of
the
regular
force
hence
her
application
to
our
firm
and
her
urgent
entreaty
that
i
would
act
with
the
utmost
despatch
soon
after
my
clients
departure
i
sought
an
interview
with
madame
von
auerbach
but
could
glean
very
little
useful
information
the
invitations
had
been
sent
out
with
great
care
but
their
exclusiveness
was
negatived
by
the
fact
that
they
were
all
sent
to
soandso
and
friend
the
position
of
those
invited
by
name
had
been
considered
sufficient
guarantee
of
the
perfect
suitability
of
the
friends
whom
they
might
select
to
accompany
them
to
the
embassy
and
at
least
a
score
of
people
had
been
present
of
whom
the
hostess
barely
heard
even
their
names
of
course
no
one
could
treat
any
single
one
of
these
individuals
as
suspects
without
some
definite
suspicion
to
work
upon
and
unfortunately
for
our
prospects
of
success
there
was
not
the
slightest
ground
for
suspecting
anyone
in
particular
i
was
about
to
quit
madame
von
auerbachs
house
when
a
servant
entered
with
a
card
upon
a
waiter
and
upon
hearing
that
the
name
inscribed
thereon
was
that
of
one
of
the
guests
of
the
previous
evening
i
hastily
decided
to
stay
a
little
longer
and
requested
madame
von
auerbach
to
keep
my
vocation
a
secret
from
her
visitor
the
next
minute
a
most
bewitching
little
woman
was
ushered
into
the
room
oh
my
dear
madame
she
exclaimed
with
a
charming
foreign
accent
such
an
unfortunate
thing
i
lost
my
beautiful
diamond
clasp
last
night
have
your
servants
seen
anything
of
it
madame
von
auerbach
turned
pale
and
i
looked
with
augmented
interest
at
the
harbinger
of
this
new
development
of
the
previous
evenings
mystery
the
depredations
had
evidently
been
on
a
large
scale
and
the
depredators
had
shown
remarkably
good
taste
in
the
choice
of
their
spoil
the
latest
victim
was
a
french
lady
named
madame
duchesne
and
she
waxed
eloquent
in
lamentations
over
her
loss
when
it
was
shown
to
her
how
little
hope
there
was
of
recovering
her
diamond
clasp
and
do
you
know
i
feel
so
terribly
upset
was
her
pathetic
protest
that
i
would
give
anything
not
to
have
had
to
go
on
with
my
own
garden
party
tomorrow
and
i
dont
like
to
say
it
but
it
is
a
fact
that
i
may
also
have
included
the
thief
in
my
invitation
and
it
would
be
awful
if
more
things
were
to
be
stolen
whatever
shall
i
do
as
no
practical
advice
seemed
to
be
forthcoming
madame
duchesne
studied
for
a
moment
and
then
announced
her
intention
of
employing
a
detective
not
a
real
horrid
policeman
she
averred
but
one
of
those
extraordinary
individuals
who
seem
able
to
look
through
and
through
you
and
who
can
find
anything
out
private
detectives
i
think
they
call
them
madame
von
auerbach
looked
up
eagerly
but
i
gave
her
a
warning
glance
which
caused
her
to
postpone
the
revelation
of
my
identity
which
she
had
felt
prompted
to
make
do
you
know
any
of
these
people
was
the
frenchwomans
appeal
to
me
can
you
help
me
to
the
address
of
one
there
are
several
firms
of
private
detectives
in
london
if
we
are
to
judge
from
their
advertisements
i
answered
i
have
heard
of
messrs
bell
and
white
of
holborn
spoken
of
as
fairly
good
but
of
course
there
are
plenty
of
others
equally
good
or
probably
better
bell
and
white
holborn
yes
i
will
try
them
thank
you
so
much
for
helping
me
may
i
ask
if
you
live
in
london
seizing
my
cue
madame
von
auerbach
promptly
came
to
my
assistance
i
am
very
angry
with
miss
gresham
she
averred
since
she
resigned
her
post
as
governess
to
the
duke
of
solothurns
children
she
has
hardly
deigned
to
take
any
notice
of
the
numerous
friends
she
made
in
germany
but
i
mean
to
make
her
stay
a
few
days
with
me
now
that
she
has
come
to
see
me
then
you
must
bring
her
with
you
to
my
garden
party
said
madame
duchesne
and
the
invitation
so
cleverly
angled
for
was
accepted
with
a
faint
pretence
of
hesitation
at
the
idea
of
inflicting
myself
upon
the
hospitality
of
a
total
stranger
after
madame
duchesnes
departure
i
congratulated
madame
von
auerbach
very
warmly
upon
her
tact
and
presence
of
mind
and
arranged
to
visit
the
garden
party
as
her
friend
the
next
day
in
due
course
the
interesting
function
was
in
full
swing
and
the
fascinating
hostess
had
quite
a
crowd
of
guests
to
look
after
my
guarantor
had
left
me
at
my
own
request
to
my
own
devices
i
wanted
to
look
about
me
and
to
note
all
that
was
going
on
without
being
too
much
in
evidence
myself
presently
madame
duchesne
approached
me
with
a
very
mysterious
air
and
introduced
a
very
handsome
man
to
my
notice
dont
be
shocked
she
whispered
but
this
is
the
private
detective
mr
bell
i
communicated
with
him
at
once
after
leaving
madame
von
auerbachs
yesterday
and
he
is
here
to
watch
that
no
pickpocket
secures
booty
here
isnt
it
too
dreadful
to
have
to
take
such
precautions
i
will
never
give
another
party
in
london
i
responded
to
this
confidential
communication
with
due
sympathy
and
gravely
acknowledged
the
attention
my
new
companion
bestowed
upon
me
for
a
few
moments
and
i
had
need
of
my
gravity
and
presence
of
mind
for
the
man
introduced
to
me
was
not
my
uncle
the
detective
i
knew
that
our
firm
had
not
been
applied
to
by
madame
duchesne
in
spite
of
her
assertion
to
the
contrary
and
as
this
was
certainly
no
one
who
had
ever
been
in
our
office
i
knew
that
certain
suspicions
that
i
had
formed
yesterday
were
likely
to
be
verified
since
this
stranger
was
certainly
no
detective
i
concluded
that
he
was
merely
posing
as
one
for
the
sake
of
diverting
suspicion
from
the
offenders
whom
i
was
anxious
to
run
to
earth
the
assumption
that
he
was
the
associate
and
helpmate
of
the
thieves
was
also
a
very
natural
one
although
a
glance
at
the
lovely
hostess
and
her
dainty
surroundings
almost
seemed
to
belie
such
a
supposition
but
i
knew
that
i
was
on
the
right
track
and
within
the
hour
my
vigilance
was
rewarded
the
sham
detective
whose
pretended
avocation
had
been
disclosed
to
none
but
madame
von
auerbach
and
myself
sauntered
from
group
to
group
as
if
intent
upon
scrutinising
their
actions
his
real
object
was
to
attach
their
jewellery
and
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
him
possess
himself
of
a
costly
watch
which
lady
a
was
wearing
in
somewhat
careless
fashion
instant
denunciation
was
not
my
intention
i
mean
to
probe
the
matter
to
the
root
and
followed
mr
bells
movements
with
apparent
nonchalance
presently
he
culled
a
couple
of
beautiful
standard
roses
and
handed
them
to
madame
duchesne
with
a
graceful
compliment
the
thing
was
beautifully
done
and
none
but
a
person
keenly
on
guard
would
have
noticed
that
the
watch
changed
hands
with
the
roses
this
little
comedy
over
madame
sauntered
towards
the
house
and
five
minutes
later
i
came
upon
her
quite
by
accident
of
course
just
as
she
was
relocking
a
dainty
cabinet
from
which
she
had
taken
a
fresh
bottle
of
perfume
in
the
use
of
which
she
was
very
lavish
there
were
two
or
three
other
people
in
madames
charming
boudoir
among
them
being
madame
von
auerbach
by
whose
side
i
seated
myself
with
an
air
of
sudden
weakness
she
was
really
startled
by
the
development
of
events
but
she
had
been
previously
cautioned
and
played
her
part
very
well
indeed
when
i
exclaimed
that
i
felt
dreadfully
ill
what
shall
i
do
she
cried
i
hope
it
is
not
one
of
your
old
attacks
yes
it
is
i
whispered
faintly
do
send
for
my
uncle
he
is
the
only
one
who
can
help
me
i
was
promptly
placed
on
the
couch
and
dosed
with
all
sorts
of
amateur
remedies
pending
the
arrival
of
my
uncle
who
had
been
sent
for
in
hot
haste
and
who
entre
nous
was
waiting
with
a
police
officer
in
private
clothes
for
the
expected
urgent
summons
no
sooner
did
they
appear
than
my
indisposition
vanished
and
i
astonished
the
bystanders
by
springing
vigorously
to
my
feet
arrest
madame
duchesne
i
cried
and
her
accomplice
pointing
to
the
latter
i
continued
that
man
has
stolen
lady
as
watch
and
it
is
locked
in
that
cabinet
what
a
scene
of
confusion
there
was
immediately
not
only
lady
a
but
several
other
people
discovered
that
they
had
been
robbed
and
the
cabinet
was
found
to
contain
a
great
quantity
of
stolen
valuables
among
them
being
mrs
bevans
muchprized
pendant
my
discovery
was
only
made
in
the
nick
of
time
in
another
twelve
hours
the
birds
would
have
flown
for
the
real
madame
duchesne
the
lady
from
whom
they
had
stolen
the
letters
of
introduction
which
had
obtained
them
the
entree
to
london
society
had
arrived
in
london
that
day
an
accomplice
had
warned
them
of
the
fact
and
as
they
knew
that
this
garden
party
they
were
giving
at
the
gorgeous
house
they
had
hired
would
be
their
last
opportunity
for
some
time
they
had
determined
to
make
a
large
haul
and
decamp
that
same
evening
luckily
for
many
people
i
was
able
to
frustrate
their
intention
at
present
they
are
lodging
in
infinitely
less
luxurious
quarters
and
several
members
of
the
upper
classes
are
much
more
careful
than
formerly
as
to
whom
they
associate
with
by
virtue
of
letters
of
introduction
viii
a
pattern
of
virtue
i
wonder
how
many
people
have
stood
on
waterloo
bridge
looking
down
upon
the
evermoving
river
and
feeling
themselves
irresistibly
attracted
by
the
weird
fascination
of
its
cruel
waters
but
one
cannot
wonder
at
the
eerie
influence
it
exerts
upon
the
miserable
one
moments
nerve
–
one
plunge
–
one
splash
–
a
short
struggle
–
and
the
stress
and
anguish
of
life
are
left
behind
and
the
hereafter
what
of
it
it
is
truly
an
inscrutable
puzzle
but
the
sudden
recollection
that
an
account
of
earthly
doings
may
be
required
of
us
in
another
world
has
nerved
many
a
desperate
victim
of
misery
to
further
endurance
and
cheated
father
thames
of
much
of
his
prey
it
was
different
with
lucy
markham
she
was
so
desperate
so
despairing
so
wildly
reckless
that
nothing
but
the
forcibly
detaining
arms
which
i
flung
around
her
would
have
prevented
her
from
jumping
into
the
river
and
putting
an
end
to
a
young
life
that
had
only
seen
seventeen
summers
let
me
go
she
shrieked
how
dare
you
hinder
me
can
i
not
do
as
i
like
with
myself
no
i
panted
as
i
vainly
strove
to
avoid
the
blows
with
which
the
frantic
girl
sought
to
release
herself
from
my
grasp
i
will
not
let
you
go
until
you
promise
that
you
will
not
put
an
end
to
your
life
let
me
go
she
repeated
i
will
do
as
i
like
all
the
world
has
forsaken
me
and
i
owe
it
no
duty
now
you
cant
hold
me
much
longer
and
you
shall
see
how
soon
i
will
end
it
all
never
if
i
dont
get
your
promise
i
will
scream
for
help
and
then
you
will
be
locked
up
until
your
senses
come
back
to
you
my
determination
had
its
effect
she
ceased
to
struggle
and
looked
solemnly
at
me
with
big
lovely
eyes
to
which
the
pale
light
of
the
moon
seemed
to
give
an
uncanny
glitter
who
are
you
she
asked
that
you
should
so
concern
yourself
about
the
fate
of
a
stranger
i
am
a
friend
of
humanity
i
hope
humanity
my
god
how
much
humanity
has
my
short
life
met
with
and
what
sort
of
a
specimen
of
humanity
do
you
suppose
me
to
be
unfortunate
that
is
evident
not
naturally
depraved
i
am
sure
the
victim
of
some
scoundrel
i
imagine
a
fitting
subject
for
help
and
counsel
that
is
certain
help
and
counsel
oh
how
i
have
prayed
for
them
and
now
it
is
too
late
but
i
saw
that
i
had
conquered
the
fierceness
of
the
girls
frenzy
had
passed
and
the
crisis
in
her
fate
was
over
poor
child
how
my
heart
bled
for
her
it
is
sad
to
witness
despair
at
any
time
but
saddest
of
all
is
it
to
recognise
the
insatiate
ghoul
on
the
face
of
those
to
whom
life
should
just
be
opening
wide
its
portals
of
joy
perhaps
i
can
afford
you
help
and
counsel
i
said
soothingly
people
would
never
find
themselves
utterly
forsaken
if
they
only
knew
to
whom
to
apply
in
their
need
tell
me
about
yourself
it
will
relieve
you
what
is
your
name
and
where
do
you
live
my
name
was
the
bitter
answer
has
been
disgraced
and
i
will
not
add
to
my
folly
by
involving
my
family
in
my
disgrace
as
for
my
home
it
is
a
truly
magnificent
one
the
air
the
sky
and
the
roaring
noises
of
civilisation
are
all
mine
to
enjoy
ad
libitum
why
i
am
quite
rich
as
the
stranger
made
the
last
remark
she
lost
her
selfrestraint
and
sobbed
with
hysterical
violence
i
felt
very
much
relieved
at
this
outburst
for
i
knew
that
though
it
would
probably
leave
the
girl
faint
and
exhausted
it
would
also
leave
her
in
a
more
gentle
and
pliable
frame
of
mind
my
judgment
proved
correct
and
i
was
presently
fully
confided
in
it
was
the
old
story
of
blind
trust
and
deliberate
betrayal
and
is
soon
told
lucy
markham
had
been
well
educated
and
delicately
reared
but
was
without
relatives
or
near
friends
at
the
time
i
found
her
her
mother
had
died
eighteen
months
before
this
the
penury
consequent
upon
the
previous
death
of
the
father
had
been
partly
met
by
disposing
of
the
furniture
and
other
effects
and
when
lucy
was
left
unprotected
she
was
also
quite
without
means
but
she
meant
to
be
very
industrious
and
attentive
to
her
duties
and
quite
expected
to
earn
her
living
easily
in
london
so
she
migrated
from
the
quiet
little
surrey
village
where
she
had
seen
so
much
sorrow
to
seek
and
to
find
employment
in
one
of
the
greatest
hives
of
wickedness
the
world
has
ever
known
to
wit
–
london
when
her
employer
began
to
pay
her
little
attentions
she
felt
flattered
when
he
requested
her
to
observe
the
strictest
secrecy
regarding
his
stealthily
bestowed
attention
she
believed
his
representation
that
her
fellow
employees
would
be
spitefully
jealous
if
they
suspected
which
way
the
wind
was
blowing
when
he
took
her
to
a
pretty
house
she
never
doubted
his
assertion
that
marriage
would
follow
immediately
upon
her
transference
thither
and
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
rapturous
pride
that
she
obeyed
his
injunctions
to
the
letter
and
allowed
herself
to
be
introduced
to
the
servant
as
mrs
maynard
just
for
the
look
of
the
thing
as
mr
collinson
said
asked
what
the
servant
would
think
of
her
being
called
mrs
collinson
soon
the
specious
schemer
replied
that
the
servant
really
knew
all
particulars
and
that
it
was
the
neighbours
for
whose
benefit
the
little
temporary
deception
was
intended
but
it
soon
transpired
that
lucy
herself
was
the
object
of
deception
the
selfstyled
mr
maynard
had
ever
some
excuse
ready
for
putting
off
the
marriage
until
his
victim
felt
herself
hopelessly
compromised
the
servant
was
his
willing
tool
and
when
he
got
tired
of
his
toys
he
had
no
difficulty
in
getting
the
servant
to
help
him
further
in
his
rascally
work
the
latter
contrived
to
tell
lucy
that
all
the
neighbours
already
looked
down
upon
her
and
that
she
being
kept
by
a
man
to
whom
she
was
not
married
was
considered
beyond
the
pale
of
respectability
innocent
the
girl
was
but
who
would
believe
her
protestations
to
that
effect
in
the
face
of
her
apparent
guilt
no
one
would
do
it
its
no
use
crying
over
spilt
milk
said
the
servant
the
master
will
be
kind
and
generous
to
you
as
long
as
he
likes
you
but
you
will
have
to
give
up
such
a
notion
as
marrying
so
rich
a
man
as
he
is
take
my
advice
and
get
all
you
can
out
of
him
while
you
have
the
chance
hell
soon
fall
in
love
with
somebody
else
lucys
heartbroken
threat
to
expose
her
betrayer
only
provoked
the
derision
of
the
servant
you
would
very
likely
get
locked
up
for
attempted
blackmailing
she
said
he
has
been
too
careful
for
such
a
greenhorn
as
you
to
circumvent
him
he
has
never
been
here
to
see
either
you
or
the
house
except
after
dark
and
nobody
would
believe
you
if
you
said
that
mr
maynard
was
mr
collinson
for
he
is
a
great
man
at
church
and
subscribes
to
everything
he
is
supposed
to
have
nearly
broken
his
heart
when
his
wife
died
and
if
ever
anybody
was
looked
upon
by
the
world
as
a
pattern
of
virtue
it
is
the
man
whom
you
a
bit
of
a
shopgirl
expected
to
marry
you
you
would
only
get
yourself
laughed
at
and
despised
so
take
my
advice
and
dont
be
fool
enough
to
fly
in
the
face
of
fortune
yet
even
after
these
revelations
the
poor
child
could
hardly
believe
in
the
utter
baseness
of
her
betrayer
but
in
her
next
interview
with
him
she
was
soon
convinced
of
the
fact
that
the
man
whom
she
in
common
with
the
rest
of
the
world
regarded
as
a
pattern
of
virtue
was
in
reality
a
monster
of
deceit
and
vice
that
night
she
escaped
from
her
pretty
home
and
from
then
until
i
saved
her
from
selfdestruction
she
had
undergone
all
manner
of
rebuffs
disappointments
and
privations
which
were
enough
to
drive
any
other
modest
girl
to
the
refuge
of
the
wretched
i
found
a
temporary
home
for
lucy
and
promised
to
put
an
end
to
her
troubles
in
some
way
or
other
nor
did
i
doubt
my
ability
to
do
this
lucy
believed
an
appeal
or
a
threat
of
exposure
to
be
equally
vain
weapons
to
use
against
mr
collinson
but
i
was
more
worldly
wise
and
more
sure
of
success
i
saw
that
as
yet
the
girl
was
not
fit
to
cope
with
the
world
and
i
determined
to
make
the
pattern
of
virtue
provide
for
her
comfort
in
this
determination
lucys
own
guileless
and
simple
nature
aided
me
though
tenacious
of
her
honour
she
did
not
recoil
from
the
idea
of
compelling
mr
collinson
to
pay
for
his
deception
as
many
a
girl
of
more
vigorous
mind
whose
feelings
had
been
outraged
would
have
done
i
confess
to
feeling
more
slightly
malicious
when
i
went
to
interview
the
great
draper
and
clothier
who
soon
found
that
he
had
a
much
more
experienced
woman
than
simple
little
lucy
to
deal
with
his
dismay
when
i
quietly
laid
the
whole
array
of
facts
before
him
and
proved
the
strength
of
my
position
was
comical
to
witness
at
first
he
tried
to
frighten
me
with
his
bogie
reputation
as
a
pattern
of
virtue
but
i
had
several
cards
up
my
sleeve
and
as
i
played
them
one
by
one
he
realised
that
if
i
were
to
make
public
exposure
of
only
onehalf
the
seedy
facts
i
had
been
able
with
the
aid
of
my
colleagues
to
rake
up
against
him
the
world
would
know
him
in
all
his
carnal
hideousness
and
a
vast
number
of
people
would
take
their
custom
elsewhere
before
i
had
done
with
him
i
convinced
him
of
the
expediency
of
providing
liberally
for
lucy
for
at
least
five
years
to
come
and
i
declined
to
be
satisfied
with
less
than
three
hundred
per
annum
for
that
period
it
was
a
bitter
pill
for
him
to
swallow
but
he
saw
no
other
way
out
of
the
embroglio
into
which
his
scoundrelly
nature
had
brought
him
and
i
carried
my
point
lucy
has
a
rare
taste
for
music
and
her
special
gifts
lie
in
the
direction
of
operatic
composition
she
is
talented
industrious
and
ambitious
and
she
is
having
the
best
tuition
obtainable
her
whole
soul
is
in
her
art
and
there
is
little
fear
that
she
will
hearken
to
the
flattery
which
her
sweet
looks
gentle
nature
and
future
prospects
evoke
when
her
five
years
of
study
are
ended
there
will
be
another
star
added
to
our
galaxy
of
genius
and
i
shall
be
more
thankful
than
ever
that
the
opportunity
was
given
me
to
rescue
a
despairing
soul
from
a
watery
grave
and
that
i
had
the
ability
to
make
a
pattern
of
virtue
pay
liberally
for
his
vices
ix
miss
rankins
rival
if
it
is
as
i
suspect
i
will
not
marry
him
you
must
use
your
utmost
endeavours
to
find
out
the
real
state
of
the
case
for
it
would
drive
me
mad
to
discover
that
after
all
my
care
i
had
become
the
dupe
of
a
mercenary
hypocrite
such
was
the
concluding
portion
of
a
communication
made
to
me
by
miss
iris
rankin
only
child
and
sole
heiress
of
the
late
john
graham
rankin
shipowner
and
millionaire
the
visit
she
paid
me
had
its
origin
in
a
conversation
which
had
taken
place
in
her
own
drawingroom
on
the
previous
afternoon
a
friend
had
paid
her
a
call
and
had
regaled
her
with
some
gossip
which
had
upset
her
considerably
this
friend
miss
cloudy
to
wit
related
how
she
in
the
capacity
of
district
visitor
in
connection
with
a
very
fashionable
church
had
met
with
a
surprising
experience
i
was
never
so
astonished
in
my
life
said
miss
cloudy
as
when
i
saw
mr
harold
gilbertson
pass
the
open
door
of
the
room
in
which
i
was
sitting
talking
to
old
mrs
tweedy
one
of
the
vicars
parishioners
the
old
lady
saw
how
surprised
i
was
and
asked
who
had
passed
the
door
in
order
that
no
mistake
might
be
made
i
merely
remarked
that
a
young
gentleman
had
gone
upstairs
and
that
i
thought
it
was
somebody
i
knew
that
is
likely
enough
said
the
old
lady
for
though
the
hansons
are
poor
now
they
havent
always
lived
in
a
neighbourhood
like
this
and
some
of
their
old
friends
come
to
see
them
yet
who
are
the
hansons
i
asked
do
you
know
anything
about
them
nothing
i
was
told
except
that
they
became
poor
when
their
father
died
they
are
two
very
pretty
young
ladies
and
i
dont
mix
much
with
the
people
hereabouts
though
they
have
always
a
pleasant
word
for
me
im
not
surprised
that
mr
gilbertson
is
smitten
and
that
he
comes
to
see
them
nearly
every
evening
i
rather
fancy
that
he
is
engaged
to
miss
beatrice
you
see
iris
it
seems
rather
a
cruel
thing
to
tell
you
but
i
know
how
you
dread
fortunehunters
and
i
know
also
that
you
would
be
miserable
with
a
man
whose
heart
was
given
to
another
it
is
much
better
to
stop
the
mischief
before
it
has
become
irrevocable
miss
rankin
fully
endorsed
the
opinion
thus
expressed
although
it
was
a
bitter
experience
for
her
to
be
told
that
the
man
to
whom
she
had
in
all
confidence
given
her
heart
was
merely
courting
her
fortune
while
his
love
was
bestowed
elsewhere
still
she
never
doubted
the
honesty
of
purpose
of
her
friend
but
was
wise
enough
to
subject
her
to
a
series
of
searching
questions
ere
she
was
fully
convinced
that
there
was
apparently
a
mistake
even
then
she
determined
to
have
additional
testimony
before
she
decided
upon
condemning
and
humiliating
the
man
to
whom
she
was
to
have
been
married
in
one
short
month
he
was
very
handsome
and
very
clever
but
his
income
had
hitherto
not
kept
pace
with
his
apparent
popularity
as
a
journalist
and
his
profession
afforded
him
an
easy
excuse
for
spending
his
evenings
away
from
his
fiancée
i
imagined
him
always
to
be
hard
at
work
every
evening
she
said
sadly
when
consulting
me
but
if
my
friend
has
really
made
no
mistake
mr
gilbertson
has
been
spending
his
evenings
in
more
congenial
fashion
than
in
working
at
his
profession
or
in
visiting
me
i
cannot
condescend
to
pursue
further
investigations
myself
but
it
will
not
be
a
very
difficult
matter
for
you
you
will
lose
no
time
over
the
business
none
whatever
was
my
prompt
assurance
and
i
kept
my
word
for
that
very
afternoon
saw
me
very
soberly
attired
and
wearing
my
most
philanthropic
expression
wending
my
way
towards
the
very
quiet
byestreet
in
which
mrs
tweedy
lived
i
was
armed
with
all
sorts
of
particulars
and
was
made
aware
of
mrs
tweedys
particular
foible
she
only
needed
to
scent
a
possible
donation
to
become
the
most
servile
and
plausible
of
individuals
she
had
always
been
poor
but
not
of
the
poorest
for
she
contrived
to
divert
a
great
many
gifts
from
indiscriminate
philanthropists
to
herself
that
ought
really
to
have
been
bestowed
elsewhere
as
i
carried
a
neat
parcel
of
groceries
by
way
of
makeweight
to
the
bundle
of
tracts
i
was
supposed
to
be
distributing
i
felt
pretty
sure
of
my
position
and
was
soon
chatting
quite
affably
with
the
cunning
old
lady
i
was
diplomatic
enough
to
pave
the
way
for
the
tract
i
had
to
offer
by
the
gift
of
a
quarter
of
tea
and
a
tin
of
salmon
after
which
i
might
have
learnt
all
there
was
to
tell
of
the
whole
neighbourhood
if
i
had
wanted
we
were
soon
chatting
quite
sociably
together
and
it
was
of
course
quite
natural
that
next
to
herself
the
old
lady
should
find
her
neighbours
her
readiest
medium
of
gossip
as
the
sisters
hanson
were
the
most
interesting
of
these
neighbours
it
was
equally
natural
that
the
conversation
should
be
easily
brought
round
to
them
i
had
carefully
studied
a
photograph
of
mr
gilbertson
with
which
i
had
been
supplied
by
miss
rankin
and
i
purposely
say
opposite
the
open
door
as
i
chatted
in
order
that
i
might
have
a
fair
look
at
the
mr
gilbertson
who
visited
the
sisters
every
evening
my
visit
was
well
timed
and
i
had
not
long
to
wait
the
misses
hansons
mr
gilbertson
passed
before
my
view
and
i
had
not
the
slightest
hesitation
in
judging
him
to
be
also
miss
rankins
mr
gilbertson
i
was
sorry
for
this
for
he
looked
so
frank
and
honest
that
anybody
might
have
trusted
him
and
it
is
sad
to
have
ones
ideals
shattered
even
if
one
be
a
detective
and
as
such
already
somewhat
inured
to
the
depressing
influence
of
treacherous
natures
but
my
task
was
by
no
means
finished
i
had
only
seen
and
heard
enough
to
corroborate
the
truth
of
miss
cloudys
statements
and
there
was
too
much
at
stake
to
permit
any
chance
of
blundering
to
survive
so
when
mr
gilbertson
went
upstairs
i
terminated
my
visit
to
the
old
lady
and
stationed
myself
where
he
could
not
emerge
from
the
house
without
being
seen
by
me
i
had
to
wait
above
an
hour
but
it
was
not
at
all
cold
and
i
was
rewarded
by
seeing
the
gentleman
come
forth
with
one
of
the
sisters
who
certainly
looked
quite
worthy
of
a
mans
love
the
couple
walked
slowly
towards
hammersmithroad
followed
unobtrusively
by
myself
who
in
the
gathering
dusk
noticed
that
they
appeared
to
be
waiting
for
some
one
as
they
sauntered
backwards
and
forwards
for
awhile
in
the
vicinity
of
st
mary
abbottsterrace
presently
they
were
joined
by
another
girl
who
came
out
of
a
neighbouring
house
carrying
a
music
roll
in
her
hand
and
who
was
sufficiently
like
mr
gilbertsons
companion
to
make
me
conclude
that
she
was
her
sister
then
the
three
retraced
their
step
homeward
and
i
had
no
difficulty
in
deciding
that
the
music
teacher
was
the
sister
to
whom
mr
gilbertson
was
supposed
to
be
engaged
i
was
surprised
at
the
openness
with
which
he
carried
on
his
clandestine
connection
for
he
seemed
not
to
care
who
noticed
him
and
it
was
certainly
running
an
apparent
risk
to
show
himself
out
of
doors
with
miss
rankins
rival
i
will
own
to
being
very
tired
before
i
got
to
bed
that
night
but
i
was
thoroughly
satisfied
for
i
had
traversed
a
great
deal
of
ground
and
learnt
a
great
many
important
particulars
of
the
case
i
was
investigating
next
morning
at
eleven
oclock
i
called
to
see
miss
rankin
at
her
sumptuous
flat
in
albertgate
mansions
and
induced
her
to
write
the
following
note
to
her
fiancée
i
cannot
see
you
before
halfpast
eight
this
evening
but
as
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
see
you
then
i
must
ask
you
to
put
your
work
on
one
side
for
once
and
be
here
at
the
time
indicated
without
fail
iris
at
eightthirty
that
evening
having
donned
orthodox
evening
wear
i
was
sitting
with
miss
rankin
waiting
for
the
development
of
my
little
plot
the
poor
girl
looked
very
pale
and
i
could
see
that
the
great
anxiety
was
almost
killing
her
but
i
knew
that
it
could
not
last
much
longer
and
a
little
thrill
of
excitement
ran
through
me
when
miss
hanson
and
mr
gilbertson
were
announced
as
they
entered
the
room
both
looking
somewhat
mystified
the
heiress
sprang
to
her
feet
and
an
angry
flush
suffused
her
face
as
she
murmured
this
is
too
much
but
in
a
moment
she
recovered
her
presence
of
mind
and
haughtily
addressed
mr
gilbertson
i
see
you
have
brought
your
intended
with
you
but
dont
you
think
you
might
have
been
off
with
the
old
love
before
you
were
on
with
the
new
i
am
not
sure
who
was
the
more
astonished
at
this
outburst
miss
rankin
herself
or
the
man
whom
she
addressed
he
too
looked
angry
and
bowing
with
studied
politeness
replied
there
seems
to
be
some
mistake
here
we
have
evidently
come
to
the
wrong
house
and
will
wish
you
good
evening
mr
gilbertson
announced
the
butler
and
lo
the
mystery
was
explained
there
were
two
romeos
in
the
field
and
miss
rankin
saw
at
a
glance
how
the
mistake
had
arisen
the
two
men
were
actually
twin
brothers
and
had
been
estranged
for
some
time
through
an
unjust
will
which
had
left
the
presumably
younger
son
penniless
while
the
other
had
a
large
income
wounded
to
the
quick
harold
declined
his
brothers
friendly
offers
and
sought
to
make
a
name
for
himself
in
the
world
of
letters
i
had
discovered
on
following
the
musicteachers
admirer
to
his
residence
that
his
christian
name
was
gilbert
not
harold
and
had
arrived
at
a
correct
conclusion
as
to
their
relationship
my
next
proceeding
was
to
plan
a
meeting
of
all
the
parties
feeling
sure
that
it
could
have
none
but
good
results
and
i
requested
the
attendance
of
mr
gilbert
gilbertson
and
miss
hanson
at
albertgate
mansions
to
meet
mr
harold
gilbertson
and
his
fiancée
as
i
expected
they
did
not
fail
to
put
in
a
punctual
appearance
with
the
result
that
there
was
happiness
and
reconciliation
all
round
both
weddings
came
off
some
time
ago
and
i
hear
that
miss
evelyn
hanson
has
become
engaged
to
a
very
nice
american
who
is
a
millionaire
–
in
dollars
x
the
path
to
fame
there
are
many
experiences
which
fall
to
the
lot
of
a
detective
that
call
forth
for
very
little
of
the
skill
with
which
detectives
are
popularly
supposed
to
be
endowed
but
which
it
would
be
a
pity
not
to
record
inasmuch
as
they
sometimes
probe
the
depths
of
pathos
of
such
a
nature
was
my
encounter
with
an
actress
whose
name
was
once
on
everybodys
tongue
but
whose
fame
and
popularity
had
declined
with
her
beauty
until
at
last
she
found
herself
on
the
borderland
of
destitution
and
starvation
i
found
her
dying
in
st
georges
hospital
whither
i
had
gone
to
receive
important
information
from
the
occupant
of
the
next
bed
to
hers
her
big
wistful
eyes
enlisted
my
sympathy
and
the
nurse
fanned
it
by
telling
me
as
much
as
she
knew
about
the
poor
soul
whose
only
prayer
now
was
that
she
might
die
soon
she
has
been
very
rich
she
said
she
is
no
other
than
the
once
famous
actress
miss
winsome
whom
all
theatregoers
went
mad
after
some
years
since
trouble
as
well
as
penury
have
brought
her
to
the
sorry
pass
you
now
see
her
in
she
has
told
me
that
she
had
two
beautiful
children
both
of
whom
died
of
typhoid
fever
and
that
the
first
intimation
which
she
had
of
their
illness
was
the
news
of
their
death
the
shock
nearly
killed
her
and
she
has
never
been
the
same
since
she
has
given
me
a
box
of
papers
to
take
care
of
for
her
if
she
gets
better
i
am
to
give
her
the
little
box
back
again
if
she
dies
i
am
to
burn
all
the
letters
but
i
am
to
see
that
a
manuscript
which
she
calls
her
confession
is
published
she
says
it
will
be
a
warning
to
others
but
i
really
dont
know
who
will
take
it
for
publication
if
she
dies
give
it
to
me
i
said
eagerly
you
know
who
i
am
i
am
about
to
publish
some
of
my
experiences
and
i
will
insert
this
among
them
the
nurse
very
willingly
agreed
to
this
and
after
going
to
the
patients
bedside
to
ascertain
if
i
could
do
anything
for
her
i
quitted
the
hospital
the
poor
soul
made
a
most
curious
request
in
response
to
my
invitation
to
tell
me
what
she
would
like
best
i
shant
live
above
a
day
or
two
she
said
but
i
would
just
like
to
taste
champagne
again
before
i
die
i
was
not
sure
that
it
was
quite
the
thing
to
do
but
i
promised
her
some
champagne
and
took
her
a
little
bottle
the
next
morning
alas
i
was
too
late
her
spirit
had
left
its
earthly
casement
and
bodily
longings
or
desires
would
trouble
her
no
more
the
end
had
come
much
more
swiftly
than
had
been
expected
but
it
could
hardly
be
regretted
since
a
prolongation
of
life
would
only
have
been
a
prolongation
of
suffering
for
one
with
her
shattered
hopes
and
constitution
she
just
went
to
sleep
said
the
nurse
and
but
for
the
fact
that
she
ceased
murmuring
the
names
of
her
children
of
whom
she
seemed
to
be
dreaming
happily
we
could
hardly
tell
when
she
passed
away
it
was
better
so
i
thought
as
i
left
the
hospital
again
with
the
little
box
which
the
nurse
had
handed
over
to
me
and
after
reading
the
ms
that
had
been
spoken
of
i
was
all
the
more
glad
that
her
end
had
been
painless
here
is
her
story
and
i
pray
my
readers
not
to
judge
her
too
harshly
had
any
one
ever
told
my
mother
that
her
daughter
would
live
to
be
the
most
talked
of
and
the
most
courted
woman
in
london
she
would
have
scouted
the
prediction
as
one
that
was
impossible
of
fulfilment
for
were
we
not
miserably
poor
and
obscure
did
not
my
estimable
parents
cultivate
the
habit
of
moonlight
flitting
in
order
to
evade
the
landlords
just
demands
had
i
not
an
uncle
in
prison
for
housebreaking
and
was
it
not
a
fact
that
my
progenitors
had
never
been
joined
in
the
bonds
of
holy
wedlock
all
these
things
were
only
too
true
but
fortunately
the
world
doesnt
inquire
too
closely
into
the
antecedents
of
successful
people
there
was
also
another
circumstance
greatly
in
my
favour
my
admirable
mother
having
been
in
the
habit
of
patronising
king
alcohol
too
freely
found
herself
unable
to
resist
his
insidious
encroachments
upon
her
constitution
and
would
have
died
young
even
if
her
end
had
not
been
accelerated
by
a
blow
received
from
her
husband
in
a
drunken
quarrel
i
was
at
this
time
about
six
years
old
as
nearly
as
i
can
judge
having
had
no
definite
information
on
the
subject
my
vagabond
of
a
father
promptly
absconded
and
quite
forgot
that
he
owned
a
lovely
daughter
certainly
dirt
and
coarse
clothing
then
hid
the
charms
which
time
and
a
knowledge
of
the
art
of
makingup
have
transformed
into
the
irresistible
toutensemble
whose
fame
is
now
worldwide
when
the
local
authorities
duly
recognising
my
unprotected
condition
transferred
me
to
the
knockemabout
workhouse
i
was
not
too
promising
a
specimen
of
humanity
for
the
many
kicks
and
blows
bestowed
upon
me
by
my
male
parent
had
pretty
nearly
frightened
the
wits
out
of
me
but
i
soon
improved
for
since
i
never
hungered
and
was
at
least
decently
clad
i
was
vastly
better
off
than
ever
i
had
been
before
perhaps
i
might
not
now
appreciate
the
food
upon
which
i
was
fed
in
those
days
but
we
judge
by
comparison
and
as
breadandscrape
had
hitherto
been
my
great
luxury
except
when
i
once
managed
to
crib
a
sheeps
trotter
from
a
stall
in
the
market
i
was
to
be
congratulated
on
the
change
in
my
fortunes
at
the
end
of
eight
years
the
monotony
of
my
life
was
broken
an
old
wardrobe
dealer
came
to
the
workhouse
in
search
of
a
cheap
servant
her
fancy
lighted
on
me
and
as
i
had
been
taught
to
read
write
sum
knit
sew
wash
and
scrub
i
was
considered
to
be
sufficiently
well
equipped
with
worldly
knowledge
to
start
lifes
battle
on
my
own
account
i
was
therefore
transferred
to
mrs
harridans
keeping
and
made
to
work
from
dawn
till
bedtime
but
i
am
by
nature
industrious
and
of
a
jolly
happygolucky
temperament
and
i
didnt
feel
particularly
miserable
even
then
a
trivial
incident
proved
the
turning
point
of
my
career
during
one
of
my
mistresss
many
absences
on
business
it
struck
me
that
i
would
don
some
of
the
tawdry
things
which
surrounded
me
so
as
to
have
a
bit
of
fun
on
my
own
account
so
i
hurried
through
my
work
quicker
than
usual
and
trusting
that
nobody
would
enter
the
shop
just
yet
i
slipped
into
a
short
rosecoloured
tarlatan
frock
cut
low
at
the
neck
and
having
mere
straps
for
sleeves
the
result
astonished
and
delighted
me
for
the
first
time
i
realised
that
i
was
dowered
with
beauty
and
i
was
admiring
myself
in
front
of
the
cracked
lookingglass
which
adorned
the
shop
when
i
was
transfixed
with
terror
by
the
arrival
of
mrs
harridan
herself
but
my
mistress
actually
looked
pleased
and
speedily
set
my
fears
at
rest
by
exclaiming
well
im
blest
if
you
aint
cut
out
for
a
pantomime
girl
you
look
spiffin
and
ive
more
than
half
a
mind
to
try
it
on
a
week
later
i
had
been
engaged
at
a
neighbouring
theatre
to
perform
in
the
ballet
of
the
forthcoming
pantomime
it
was
also
arranged
that
i
should
live
with
mrs
harridan
and
help
with
some
of
her
work
besides
giving
her
the
greater
part
of
my
earnings
in
exchange
for
my
board
and
lodgings
but
she
wasnt
really
hard
on
me
and
gave
me
many
a
bit
of
useful
finery
indeed
i
shall
never
forget
that
she
was
my
first
real
friend
and
i
am
glad
to
be
able
to
make
her
a
small
weekly
allowance
now
that
she
is
past
work
brevity
will
not
permit
me
to
dwell
on
my
early
professional
struggles
though
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
was
apt
and
industrious
it
took
me
several
years
to
achieve
popularity
i
was
admittedly
beautiful
and
could
act
sing
and
dance
to
perfection
but
i
was
not
able
to
make
such
a
display
as
some
of
my
less
scrupulous
fellow
artistes
they
boasted
the
protection
of
this
that
or
the
other
profligate
who
invariably
did
his
best
to
popularise
the
efforts
of
his
favourite
for
a
long
time
i
prided
myself
on
my
virtue
then
i
came
to
understand
the
real
cause
of
my
failure
and
accepted
the
attentions
of
viscount
s
he
has
provided
quite
handsomely
for
my
two
children
who
are
being
educated
in
the
belief
that
they
are
the
orphans
of
a
respectable
couple
called
mervyn
but
even
yet
i
failed
to
reach
the
pinnacle
of
fame
which
i
coveted
although
i
had
ample
means
of
display
and
i
cast
round
for
another
mode
of
attaining
my
object
i
found
my
social
stepladder
in
the
person
of
young
lord
f
who
became
desperately
enamoured
with
me
and
was
for
a
while
more
than
anxious
to
marry
me
of
course
i
forgot
to
tell
him
about
my
two
children
but
i
made
the
best
of
my
opportunities
knowing
full
well
that
lord
fs
infatuation
could
not
last
and
when
he
really
did
show
an
inclination
to
fight
shy
of
the
engagement
i
had
plenty
of
people
to
prove
that
it
had
been
an
existing
fact
three
months
later
the
cause
celebre
of
the
day
was
the
breach
of
promise
action
brought
by
miss
winsome
against
lord
f
there
was
no
vigorous
attempt
at
a
defence
i
won
my
case
hands
over
together
with
damages
i
also
won
the
notoriety
i
craved
for
and
the
photographs
of
the
beautiful
and
illtreated
miss
winsome
were
shown
in
every
fancy
shop
window
in
the
country
managers
ran
after
me
i
could
dictate
my
own
terms
my
audiences
adored
me
showered
presents
and
bouquets
upon
me
and
they
have
more
than
once
unharnessed
my
horses
and
drawn
me
to
my
hotel
in
triumph
i
have
gained
the
summit
of
my
ambition
but
oh
god
how
i
do
crave
for
a
little
real
honest
love
and
sympathy
i
would
give
the
world
to
be
able
to
retire
with
my
beautiful
innocent
children
to
some
place
where
they
could
never
learn
that
their
mother
is
anything
but
one
of
the
best
and
purest
of
women
but
how
foolish
i
am
why
do
i
imagine
vain
things
i
am
quite
happy
–
sometimes
xi
the
recluse
of
hallow
hall
yes
maam
said
old
miles
galbraith
to
me
yes
i
can
tell
you
as
queer
a
tale
as
here
and
there
a
one
in
fact
if
you
find
one
to
beat
it
ill
forego
that
little
acknowledgment
you
promised
me
fie
miles
was
my
amused
retort
you
have
already
received
the
little
acknowledgement
in
question
and
have
spent
part
of
it
so
how
can
you
forego
it
indeed
maam
its
all
right
you
see
i
know
the
little
ways
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
they
always
pay
half
when
they
make
the
bargain
and
the
other
half
at
the
end
of
the
story
hm
youre
very
cute
miles
but
it
will
all
depend
upon
what
you
have
to
tell
me
then
well
consider
it
settled
maam
if
you
please
so
here
goes
when
i
first
went
to
be
mr
milsoms
gardener
and
coachman
he
had
quite
a
staff
of
servants
in
the
house
for
he
still
kept
considerable
company
among
these
servants
was
jenny
pryce
the
under
housemaid
as
canny
a
girl
as
ever
went
to
place
and
i
thought
myself
lucky
when
she
promised
to
marry
me
but
mr
wright
the
butler
didnt
half
like
it
he
was
fond
of
her
himself
and
both
he
and
the
housekeeper
had
a
lot
to
say
about
how
foolish
she
was
to
promise
to
marry
anybody
whose
station
was
so
inferior
to
a
butlers
all
the
same
jenny
had
her
own
notions
on
the
subject
and
at
last
she
had
to
shut
him
up
somewhat
sharply
when
the
master
heard
about
our
love
affair
he
was
very
good
indeed
to
us
and
furnished
the
little
cottage
in
which
we
live
to
this
day
the
butler
was
never
friendly
to
us
and
would
have
cleared
me
off
the
premises
if
he
could
have
done
so
the
master
however
soon
after
this
took
to
very
queer
ways
it
was
said
that
he
had
been
crossed
in
love
and
that
he
had
vowed
never
to
look
in
a
womans
face
again
be
that
as
it
may
he
withdrew
from
all
society
and
by
degrees
even
ceased
to
walk
about
in
his
own
grounds
then
he
made
an
arrangement
with
his
solicitor
whereby
we
were
all
put
on
board
wages
and
very
liberal
they
were
too
jenny
came
in
for
them
as
well
as
she
was
supposed
to
be
the
masters
laundress
now
that
she
was
married
though
its
mighty
little
washing
he
ever
gave
her
to
do
there
was
henceforth
no
interference
in
anything
we
did
there
being
certain
rules
prescribed
by
the
master
and
as
long
as
we
conformed
to
these
rules
we
were
all
to
keep
our
comfortable
places
for
two
or
three
years
mr
milsom
lived
on
like
that
never
going
out
and
never
seeing
anybody
at
last
he
wouldnt
even
take
his
meals
in
the
dining
or
breakfastrooms
but
had
one
end
of
the
house
disconnected
from
the
other
part
that
we
could
only
approach
his
rooms
by
one
door
these
rooms
were
very
comfortably
furnished
with
all
sorts
of
beautiful
things
collected
by
the
masters
orders
from
other
parts
of
the
house
the
room
that
he
called
his
library
had
thousands
of
books
in
it
the
first
room
that
we
entered
from
the
corridor
was
the
one
in
which
he
took
all
his
meals
and
after
a
time
we
were
forbidden
to
go
any
further
we
would
enter
this
room
clean
it
set
out
his
food
very
elaborately
on
the
table
and
then
retire
only
returning
when
we
heard
his
bell
ring
for
us
to
clear
the
things
away
there
would
always
be
a
paper
on
the
table
containing
various
orders
but
the
master
himself
no
longer
appeared
to
give
them
in
person
in
fact
for
several
years
not
one
of
us
was
permitted
to
see
him
and
he
always
kept
his
door
locked
when
he
was
in
his
diningroom
at
first
these
eccentricities
caused
a
deal
of
comment
but
byandby
the
neighbourhood
found
new
sensations
to
talk
about
and
the
recluse
of
hallow
hall
as
mr
milsom
came
to
be
called
was
by
lots
of
people
entirely
forgotten
but
although
we
were
not
permitted
to
look
upon
the
masters
face
he
did
not
allow
us
to
forget
his
presence
for
he
was
very
particular
about
the
food
he
ate
he
liked
several
courses
to
each
meal
and
they
had
to
be
beautifully
cooked
or
he
would
tell
us
his
opinion
pretty
plainly
the
fruit
i
raised
for
him
had
to
be
of
the
very
finest
too
or
he
would
threaten
to
dismiss
me
this
however
did
not
often
happen
for
we
all
knew
that
we
would
never
get
such
another
comfortable
place
where
we
all
did
pretty
nearly
as
we
liked
and
we
were
careful
to
see
that
the
master
had
as
little
cause
for
complaint
as
possible
if
any
of
us
had
an
apology
to
make
or
anything
to
ask
him
we
would
write
what
we
wanted
to
say
on
a
piece
of
paper
each
these
papers
would
be
put
on
the
table
with
the
masters
meals
and
we
would
receive
our
answers
soon
after
the
only
body
that
ever
seemed
inclined
to
grumble
at
this
queer
state
of
affairs
was
mr
wright
the
butler
and
he
was
never
satisfied
first
he
growled
about
one
thing
then
about
another
and
he
was
altogether
so
illtempered
that
the
rest
of
us
threatened
to
complain
of
him
in
a
body
i
think
the
best
thing
you
can
do
mr
wright
is
to
clear
out
you
have
got
too
big
for
your
place
to
my
thinking
this
was
what
the
housekeeper
said
to
him
one
day
and
you
should
have
seen
the
evil
look
he
put
on
his
face
as
he
shook
his
fist
at
her
and
shouted
maybe
i
will
leave
the
place
mighty
soon
and
in
a
way
you
little
expect
too
and
sure
enough
he
disappeared
that
very
night
and
everything
went
to
prove
that
it
was
a
deliberately
planned
flight
none
of
us
felt
sorry
at
losing
him
but
we
were
all
considerably
dismayed
to
find
that
the
greater
part
of
the
family
plate
had
disappeared
with
him
he
must
have
had
enough
to
do
to
carry
it
away
unnoticed
and
unheard
at
first
we
didnt
know
what
to
do
then
i
suggested
going
for
the
police
but
the
housekeeper
said
no
we
must
do
nothing
without
asking
the
masters
advice
first
to
this
we
agreed
and
an
account
of
the
butlers
disappearance
together
with
a
list
of
things
he
had
stolen
was
written
and
taken
in
with
the
breakfast
presently
there
was
a
furious
peal
at
the
bell
and
the
housekeeper
asked
me
to
fetch
the
note
we
felt
sure
the
master
had
been
writing
be
quick
galbraith
said
she
im
on
tenterhooks
to
know
how
hell
take
it
and
what
we
are
to
do
perhaps
hell
come
out
of
his
shell
now
and
live
more
like
a
civilised
human
being
he
used
to
set
great
store
by
the
silver
plate
its
been
in
his
family
more
than
twohundred
years
but
so
far
from
coming
out
of
his
shell
the
master
became
if
possible
a
more
confirmed
recluse
than
ever
his
instructions
to
us
were
brief
and
to
the
point
take
no
steps
to
discover
wright
was
his
order
let
his
greed
be
his
own
punishment
what
he
has
stolen
does
not
equal
the
legacy
i
would
have
left
him
henceforth
do
not
name
him
to
me
let
him
be
as
one
dead
and
do
not
expect
a
successor
in
his
place
my
wants
become
fewer
as
i
get
more
feeble
and
i
cannot
tolerate
the
idea
of
having
new
people
about
the
house
but
i
never
forget
those
who
are
faithful
to
me
and
a
word
to
the
wise
is
sufficient
we
took
this
last
to
mean
that
he
would
remember
us
in
his
will
if
we
served
him
well
but
this
we
had
always
done
so
well
indeed
that
we
couldnt
improve
ourselves
soon
after
this
there
was
a
letter
to
mr
milsoms
solicitors
to
be
forwarded
then
a
very
big
one
was
sent
to
which
mr
crowday
the
lawyer
brought
back
an
answer
and
being
curious
he
went
and
laid
it
on
his
masters
table
himself
but
all
was
as
quiet
as
it
generally
was
and
he
went
away
no
wiser
for
his
pains
before
he
went
he
told
the
housekeeper
that
the
master
had
been
making
a
new
will
but
he
wouldnt
say
what
it
was
soon
after
this
a
queer
rumour
arose
in
the
neighbourhood
it
was
said
that
the
butler
had
been
murdered
and
that
his
ghost
haunted
the
park
belonging
to
hallow
hall
i
dont
know
that
we
exactly
believed
this
rumour
but
we
none
of
us
cared
to
be
out
too
late
alone
at
night
after
a
while
we
began
to
think
the
master
must
be
failing
for
he
was
often
a
whole
day
without
taking
any
of
the
food
that
was
so
carefully
prepared
for
him
this
made
us
anxious
and
we
used
to
listen
more
intently
than
ever
for
any
sign
of
life
within
the
rooms
we
were
not
allowed
to
enter
but
this
sort
of
thing
went
on
for
five
years
and
by
that
time
the
folks
in
the
neighbourhood
looked
upon
both
the
house
and
the
grounds
as
uncanny
and
haunted
one
day
jenny
and
i
were
both
indoors
helping
the
housekeeper
as
she
was
having
a
thorough
cleaning
down
as
was
often
the
case
i
took
my
turn
at
carrying
some
of
mr
milsoms
food
into
his
diningroom
but
i
had
no
sooner
set
foot
in
it
than
i
heard
a
terrible
groaning
in
one
of
the
inner
rooms
for
a
moment
i
looked
as
scared
as
did
jenny
who
was
with
me
then
i
rushed
at
the
door
and
never
rested
till
i
had
broken
it
down
at
last
i
was
inside
the
place
i
had
often
been
so
curious
about
but
i
shall
never
forget
how
astonished
i
was
at
what
i
saw
on
a
rich
turkey
carpet
which
covered
the
floor
lay
a
man
writhing
in
pain
i
rushed
to
him
and
raised
on
to
the
couch
–
not
my
master
as
i
had
expected
but
wright
the
exbutler
he
was
in
horrible
agony
but
he
actually
twisted
his
features
into
a
grin
when
he
saw
my
amazement
yes
its
me
he
gasped
ive
been
living
here
all
these
years
in
clover
and
none
of
you
fools
any
wiser
for
it
though
i
doubt
im
done
for
now
but
the
master
i
asked
been
dead
more
than
five
years
it
cant
hurt
me
now
to
confess
i
killed
him
and
buried
him
under
the
blighted
oak
in
the
park
i
let
go
of
wright
when
i
heard
this
by
that
time
all
the
rest
of
the
household
came
flying
in
wright
had
accidentally
swallowed
some
poison
and
died
that
night
before
he
died
he
told
us
how
he
managed
to
get
at
the
old
master
and
kill
him
by
means
of
a
pass
key
he
had
had
made
for
him
he
was
able
to
get
into
the
inner
room
and
the
rest
was
easy
he
removed
the
silver
knowing
that
we
would
think
he
had
stolen
it
he
had
for
months
imitated
the
masters
writing
and
effectually
deceived
everybody
the
reputed
ghost
which
had
been
seen
in
the
park
was
himself
he
got
in
and
out
through
an
old
cellar
and
when
we
thought
he
was
ailing
because
his
food
was
not
eaten
he
was
enjoying
himself
elsewhere
he
had
procured
large
sums
of
money
through
mr
milsoms
solicitors
who
certainly
wondered
but
did
not
hesitate
to
supply
it
he
meant
to
have
made
one
more
haul
ere
leaving
hallow
hall
for
ever
when
he
made
the
fatal
mistake
which
ended
his
life
sure
enough
we
found
the
masters
body
under
the
oak
and
removed
it
in
a
suitable
coffin
to
the
family
vault
of
course
the
will
which
wright
had
written
was
useless
for
this
we
were
rather
sorry
as
it
provided
handsomely
for
us
all
still
we
have
no
need
to
grumble
for
the
gentleman
who
succeeded
to
the
estate
as
heiratlaw
–
there
being
no
will
–
treated
us
all
very
well
in
fact
were
his
servants
to
this
day
and
weve
no
notion
of
seeking
fresh
places
thank
you
maam
i
knew
you
would
like
my
tale
vii
the
mysterious
thief
now
miss
bell
said
my
uncle
to
me
one
day
i
have
a
nice
little
job
for
you
a
certain
mr
flowers
of
kitestreet
city
has
had
no
fewer
than
five
different
thefts
from
his
house
within
three
months
the
thief
seems
to
go
very
cunningly
about
his
work
for
so
far
he
has
proved
absolutely
undetectable
although
the
police
have
had
the
matter
in
hand
from
the
first
and
of
what
nature
are
the
things
that
have
been
stolen
i
asked
well
their
variety
would
be
amusing
were
it
not
so
perplexing
said
mr
bell
the
first
thing
that
was
missed
was
a
small
scripbox
containing
a
recently
executed
will
and
some
important
trust
deeds
mr
flowers
i
should
mention
is
a
solicitor
who
resides
in
rooms
over
the
premises
on
which
he
carries
on
his
business
of
course
he
was
in
a
great
state
about
losing
such
responsible
property
but
not
the
slightest
clue
to
the
perpetrators
of
the
theft
could
be
discovered
if
it
had
been
my
own
property
that
had
been
stolen
i
would
not
have
minded
so
much
said
mr
flowers
but
trust
deeds
it
is
too
dreadful
various
theories
were
promulgated
as
to
the
nature
and
motives
of
the
thief
the
most
feasible
one
being
that
someone
hearing
that
a
relative
had
made
a
will
had
conceived
that
it
was
inimical
to
his
interests
and
had
resolved
to
steal
it
from
the
solicitor
with
whom
he
believed
it
to
have
been
deposited
as
however
the
abstracted
will
was
that
of
an
old
lady
who
had
no
relations
or
friends
who
could
have
expected
her
money
even
this
theory
suffered
from
objections
in
a
few
weeks
it
was
exploded
altogether
for
a
second
robbery
took
place
at
the
house
of
mr
flowers
this
time
it
was
the
greater
part
of
the
silver
plate
that
was
missing
experts
were
all
agreed
that
the
thief
knew
the
whole
of
the
interior
arrangements
of
the
establishment
clerks
and
servants
were
all
subjected
to
rigid
crossquestioning
and
watching
but
came
out
of
the
ordeal
with
flying
colours
mr
flowers
in
fact
considered
them
all
above
suspicion
but
it
was
natural
that
for
a
time
the
detectives
should
hardly
be
of
his
opinion
very
soon
robbery
number
three
was
discovered
mrs
flowerss
watch
and
chain
had
disappeared
two
days
later
three
bank
notes
of
each
were
missing
these
mr
flowers
was
sure
he
had
first
locked
in
a
cashbox
then
in
the
office
safe
after
watching
the
departure
of
his
two
clerks
and
the
office
boy
he
carefully
looked
to
the
safety
of
the
windows
to
which
some
patent
burglar
alarms
had
lately
been
attached
then
he
locked
and
doublelocked
the
office
door
taking
all
the
keys
upstairs
with
him
and
putting
them
under
his
pillow
yet
strange
to
say
on
entering
the
office
next
morning
before
the
arrival
of
his
clerks
he
found
the
notes
missing
all
the
doors
and
locks
were
exactly
as
he
had
left
them
yet
on
opening
the
cashbox
it
was
found
to
be
empty
by
this
time
both
he
and
those
in
his
employ
were
thoroughly
scared
and
one
of
the
clerks
told
me
this
morning
that
he
and
his
colleagues
had
only
refrained
from
giving
mr
flowers
notice
to
leave
because
they
feared
their
reluctance
to
stay
might
be
construed
into
a
virtual
admission
of
their
own
participation
in
the
mysterious
thefts
this
morning
matters
reached
a
climax
when
mr
flowers
on
rising
discovered
his
own
watch
to
have
disappeared
as
completely
as
that
of
his
wife
had
done
i
was
sent
for
to
see
if
i
could
throw
any
light
on
this
strange
affair
i
found
mr
flowers
looking
the
picture
of
rage
and
mystification
and
his
clerks
were
sulkily
proceeding
with
their
work
their
expressions
almost
indicating
a
dawning
disbelief
in
the
extent
of
their
employers
losses
the
office
boy
struck
me
as
looking
rather
jubilant
he
evidently
revels
in
the
sensational
in
the
more
private
part
of
the
establishment
things
looked
no
better
the
lady
of
the
house
was
in
hysterics
and
the
housemaid
was
packing
up
her
clothes
and
vowing
that
if
they
locked
her
up
for
it
she
wouldnt
stay
any
longer
in
a
place
that
was
haunted
asked
if
she
had
seen
anything
that
could
warrant
her
assertion
that
the
house
was
haunted
she
replied
that
nothing
but
a
ghost
could
take
the
money
and
jewellery
out
of
lockedup
places
without
having
been
near
the
keys
the
latter
being
invariably
found
where
they
had
been
put
before
the
master
went
to
bed
i
managed
to
persuade
the
housemaid
into
a
more
pliant
frame
of
mind
by
promising
to
bring
her
an
associate
to
help
in
the
work
and
keep
the
cook
and
herself
company
until
all
the
mystery
had
been
made
clear
the
cook
was
easier
to
deal
with
for
she
had
arrived
at
a
pitch
of
unbelief
that
was
positively
amusing
im
about
sick
of
all
the
fuss
and
bother
there
has
been
lately
she
said
and
i
wont
be
worried
any
more
over
it
its
my
opinion
that
there
aint
never
been
a
single
thing
stole
and
that
the
masters
trying
to
get
up
a
sensation
all
for
nothing
but
where
are
the
things
if
they
havent
been
stolen
i
asked
well
betwixt
you
and
me
i
think
there
aint
two
ways
about
it
ive
lived
in
families
before
where
they
was
pretty
hard
up
for
ready
money
sometimes
and
were
only
too
ready
to
do
it
do
what
why
pawn
em
to
be
sure
what
pawn
banknotes
no
the
banknotes
havent
been
pawned
theres
no
need
of
that
i
expect
theyve
been
paid
away
for
something
on
the
quiet
the
master
wouldnt
be
the
first
man
that
had
secrets
from
his
wife
and
how
about
the
papers
you
dont
imagine
anybody
would
take
them
in
pawn
do
you
humph
as
if
that
wasnt
a
part
of
the
bamboozlement
you
dont
throw
dust
in
my
eyes
too
long
with
this
remark
the
cook
clenched
the
conversation
and
i
must
confess
that
my
thoughts
had
wandered
for
some
time
somewhat
in
the
same
direction
the
incredulous
looks
of
at
least
one
of
the
clerks
also
bore
out
the
cooks
reasoning
still
if
the
object
was
merely
to
bamboozle
his
wife
why
should
the
owner
of
the
property
said
to
be
stolen
make
such
a
fuss
and
go
to
such
an
expense
to
bring
about
an
unravelment
that
could
but
be
inimical
to
his
own
interests
if
he
were
playing
a
double
game
the
whole
case
is
as
complex
and
awkward
as
any
i
have
come
across
and
i
want
your
help
in
it
i
had
listened
very
attentively
to
my
uncles
story
and
had
already
framed
my
own
idea
of
the
duties
expected
of
me
you
wish
me
to
keep
a
careful
watch
upon
all
the
people
in
the
flowers
establishment
while
professing
to
discharge
domestic
duties
i
suggested
precisely
was
the
answer
both
mr
and
mrs
flowers
approve
of
the
plan
and
you
are
expected
today
a
few
more
preliminaries
being
settled
i
prepared
myself
at
once
for
my
new
duties
and
found
on
arriving
at
kitestreet
that
i
was
supposed
to
be
a
temporary
housekeeper
vice
mrs
flowers
herself
incapacitated
through
trouble
and
anxiety
consequent
upon
the
mysterious
series
of
robberies
that
had
taken
place
in
the
house
the
poor
womans
incapacity
for
supervising
the
daily
routine
of
her
household
was
not
feigned
she
was
really
so
ill
and
upset
that
i
advised
her
to
put
herself
under
the
care
of
the
family
doctor
who
would
give
her
something
to
quieten
her
nerves
meanwhile
if
she
would
lie
down
and
rest
i
told
her
i
would
see
that
things
were
so
conducted
in
the
kitchen
and
elsewhere
that
mr
flowers
should
miss
none
of
his
accustomed
comforts
it
was
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
that
she
yielded
herself
to
my
arrangement
and
i
also
found
the
servants
easy
to
cope
with
the
principal
topic
of
conversation
both
in
parlours
and
kitchens
was
the
facility
with
which
it
seemed
possible
for
somebody
or
other
to
take
what
they
pleased
out
of
the
house
before
bed
time
i
had
gleaned
every
possible
item
of
information
relating
to
the
mystery
and
had
formed
my
theory
as
to
the
true
state
of
things
after
office
hours
mr
flowers
fastened
his
lower
premises
up
with
all
possible
care
and
as
soon
as
i
could
do
so
without
being
observed
by
the
servants
i
carefully
examined
all
the
fastenings
and
satisfied
myself
that
the
individual
who
entered
from
without
would
be
very
clever
indeed
he
would
in
fact
have
to
be
of
the
shadowy
nature
attributed
to
the
thieves
by
the
housemaid
at
twelve
oclock
everyone
in
the
house
except
myself
had
gone
to
bed
but
so
far
from
retiring
to
rest
myself
i
had
resolved
to
keep
careful
watch
all
night
i
had
wrapped
a
thick
woollen
shawl
round
my
shoulders
and
stationed
myself
so
that
i
commanded
a
full
view
of
the
doors
leading
from
the
various
bedrooms
lest
i
should
be
observed
myself
i
took
advantage
of
a
portiere
which
shrouded
a
recess
used
as
a
wardrobe
and
anxiously
kept
the
stairhead
in
sight
i
am
not
of
a
nervous
disposition
but
i
confess
i
felt
a
wee
bit
eerie
as
the
big
hall
clock
chimed
the
hours
and
half
hours
while
all
else
in
the
house
was
as
still
as
death
it
was
therefore
with
an
intense
feeling
of
thankfulness
that
i
at
last
saw
mr
flowers
emerge
slowly
but
cautiously
from
his
bedroom
carrying
in
one
hand
a
bunch
of
keys
and
in
the
other
a
lighted
candle
he
went
straight
downstairs
and
holding
my
very
breath
through
fear
of
betraying
my
presence
i
followed
him
from
the
bedroom
floor
to
the
drawingroom
floor
thence
further
downstairs
to
the
basement
finally
walking
with
a
strange
rigidity
which
would
have
struck
me
as
awesome
had
i
not
conjectured
its
cause
he
preceded
me
into
the
cellars
which
underlay
the
whole
building
a
minute
or
two
later
he
was
opening
an
old
disused
cupboard
into
which
i
saw
him
place
two
rings
that
he
had
brought
downstairs
with
him
it
was
a
clear
case
of
somnambulism
but
i
dare
not
wake
him
there
and
then
only
pausing
for
an
instant
to
consider
what
was
best
to
be
done
next
i
noiselessly
hurried
upstairs
entered
mrs
flowerss
bedroom
and
roused
her
from
a
heavy
slumber
i
had
scarcely
succeeded
in
making
her
understand
me
when
we
heard
her
husband
coming
upstairs
again
almost
beside
herself
with
alarm
she
jumped
out
of
bed
and
in
spite
of
my
caution
gave
a
loud
scream
when
she
saw
the
glassy
and
expressionless
look
in
her
husbands
eyes
a
moment
later
there
was
a
somewhat
wild
scene
between
the
two
for
mr
flowers
was
rudely
awakened
and
could
not
understand
my
presence
in
his
bedroom
at
first
when
at
last
he
was
made
to
comprehend
the
state
of
affairs
he
expressed
himself
determined
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
mystery
at
once
i
retired
until
the
pair
had
arrayed
themselves
more
decorously
then
the
three
of
us
explored
the
cellar
cupboard
together
and
just
as
i
had
expected
we
found
all
the
precious
things
which
mr
flowerss
anxiety
had
caused
his
sleeping
senses
to
put
in
a
place
of
safety
of
which
he
had
no
recollection
when
awake
the
shock
of
his
sudden
awakening
did
him
no
harm
but
it
cured
his
somnambulistic
tendencies
and
there
have
been
no
further
supposed
robberies
from
kitestreet
the
end
