call
to
battle
in
the
year
charles
the
fifth
emperor
of
germany
the
celebrated
son
of
ferdinand
and
isabella
of
spain
laid
siege
to
the
town
of
metz
famous
then
as
now
for
its
fortifications
and
for
its
cathedral
which
is
one
of
the
finest
in
europe
it
had
lately
been
taken
possession
of
by
the
french
and
the
emperor
vainly
endeavoured
to
regain
it
it
was
at
the
time
abovenamed
defended
by
francis
duke
of
guise
one
of
the
most
illustrious
warriors
of
france
who
by
his
military
career
as
well
as
his
high
personal
advantages
added
not
a
little
to
the
lustre
of
the
house
of
lorraine
his
defence
of
metz
was
amongst
his
most
distinguished
military
exploits
amongst
the
german
troops—who
not
less
brave
than
those
of
spain
and
italy
far
surpassed
them
in
discipline
and
humanity—was
serving
at
the
time
our
story
commences
a
soldier
of
the
name
of
gaspard
stettele
a
native
of
munderkingen
a
town
of
suabia
seated
on
the
danube
gaspard
was
not
only
remarkable
for
his
courage
and
the
diligence
with
which
he
discharged
his
military
duties
but
also
for
his
honesty
and
kindness
of
heart
which
together
with
other
good
qualities
had
secured
for
him
the
approbation
and
esteem
of
his
superiors
as
well
as
the
goodwill
and
respect
of
his
fellowsoldiers
a
sincere
piety
somewhat
rare
amongst
men
of
his
calling
regulated
his
life
and
conversation
gaspard
never
went
into
action
without
on
his
knees
imploring
protection
from
one
whom
he
well
knew
could
preserve
him
in
every
danger
before
the
war
of
which
we
are
speaking
gaspard
had
married
a
young
village
girl
katherine
stiess
and
the
union
had
been
a
happy
one
for
both
katherine
was
industrious
frugal
and
devoted
to
her
husband
and
by
the
economy
and
order
with
which
she
managed
her
little
family
she
had
kept
them
free
from
want
this
was
not
always
easy
as
her
husband
would
not
like
other
soldiers
enrich
himself
by
pillage
and
would
no
more
have
robbed
a
fallen
and
helpless
enemy
than
he
would
a
countryman
or
a
friend
then
as
now
soldiers
scrupled
not
to
appropriate
all
that
the
chances
of
war
threw
in
their
way—not
so
gaspard
he
on
the
contrary
grieved
at
the
rapacity
and
unfeeling
cruelty
with
which
his
comrades
too
often
despoiled
those
who
could
offer
no
resistance
and
daily
returned
from
the
scene
of
strife
with
only
the
approbation
of
his
own
conscience
whilst
many
of
his
comrades
were
loaded
with
booty
but
too
frequently
cruelly
obtained
if
katherine
was
sometimes
tempted
to
regret
that
she
was
not
as
well
off
as
those
who
were
thus
enriched
she
quickly
checked
the
feeling
and
recollected
with
thankfulness
that
no
act
of
cruelty
or
dishonesty
could
be
laid
to
her
husbands
charge
and
that
their
fare
however
poor
was
honestly
obtained
three
children
had
been
born
to
gladden
the
little
home
the
two
eldest
in
health
and
strength
were
all
their
parents
could
desire
the
third
too
tender
to
stand
the
life
its
parents
were
obliged
to
lead
was
early
taken
from
them
and
they
had
deeply
sorrowed
at
its
loss—the
only
event
that
had
clouded
their
happiness
during
the
eight
years
of
their
married
life
at
the
same
time
both
gaspard
and
his
good
wife
knew
too
well
from
whom
the
trial
came
to
murmur
under
it
and
perhaps
there
were
even
moments
when
they
might
think
with
thankfulness
that
their
darling
was
safe
from
the
various
trials
and
troubles
from
which
they
could
not
have
shielded
it
had
it
been
spared
to
them
it
had
been
the
custom
of
gaspard
and
his
wife
to
observe
their
respective
birthdays
as
days
of
pleasure
and
rejoicing
and
to
offer
such
little
tokens
of
affection
as
it
was
in
their
power
to
bestow
gaspard
especially
according
to
the
custom
of
all
foreign
countries
had
never
omitted
presenting
his
wife
with
some
small
gift
varying
with
the
means
he
had
at
his
command
katherines
birthday
or
rather
fêteday
was
now
approaching
and
gaspard
feared
lest
he
should
for
the
first
time
be
obliged
to
forgo
this
pleasure
the
soldiers
had
been
three
weeks
without
their
pay
in
consequence
of
which
gaspard
and
katherine
had
found
it
difficult
to
provide
for
their
daily
wants
and
had
been
forced
to
take
what
little
they
had
saved
by
strict
economy
to
enable
them
to
get
on
gaspard
felt
sad
as
the
day
drew
near
to
think
he
should
be
unable
to
offer
his
beloved
katherine
his
customary
gift
meantime
he
found
that
his
regiment
had
received
orders
to
join
a
part
of
the
spanish
army
for
the
purpose
of
endeavouring
to
take
by
assault
a
post
of
some
importance
about
two
leagues
from
metz
occupied
by
the
french
as
soon
as
gaspard
was
informed
of
this
he
hastened
back
to
the
hut
occupied
by
his
family
in
those
days
the
huts
or
cabins
in
which
soldiers
were
obliged
to
live
during
a
campaign
were
miserable
enough
four
strong
stakes
or
poles
served
to
support
a
thin
roofing
of
planks
which
was
roughly
covered
over
with
moss
or
straw
the
sides
being
formed
of
branches
of
trees
interlaced
with
each
other
and
plastered
over
with
clay
through
which
the
rain
and
light
equally
penetrated
gaspards
little
dwelling
in
no
respect
differed
from
those
of
his
comrades
save
in
the
neatness
and
cleanliness
of
its
interior
in
the
centre
of
this
temporary
home
was
a
cask
on
which
was
laid
a
board
that
served
as
a
table
and
which
though
rude
and
rough
was
clean
and
decent
around
were
small
beds
of
chaff
and
straw
with
coarse
woollen
bedclothes
that
of
the
good
soldier
was
ornamented
with
a
large
bearskin
bequeathed
to
him
by
his
grandfather
who
had
killed
a
bear
of
unusual
size
in
hungary
above
these
humble
beds
hung
a
large
cross
which
had
been
given
to
gaspards
good
and
pious
mother
by
the
superior
of
a
convent
in
strasburg
and
which
her
son
held
in
great
veneration
near
the
cross
hung
the
soldiers
armour—his
helmet
sword
and
cuirass
when
gaspard
entered
this
humble
dwelling
katherine
was
busy
preparing
the
evening
meal
his
two
children
ran
eagerly
to
welcome
his
return—michael
the
eldest
impatient
to
display
a
sword
he
had
ingeniously
cut
out
of
a
piece
of
wood
and
the
youngest
john
no
less
so
to
show
a
helmet
he
had
made
of
gilt
paper
and
adorned
with
a
few
feathers
he
had
picked
up
the
father
readily
praised
his
childrens
work
and
then
laying
aside
his
arms
he
seated
himself
calling
his
wife
to
his
side
katherine
said
he
with
illdisguised
emotion
tomorrow
by
daybreak
we
march
there
is
to
be
an
encounter
with
the
french
about
two
leagues
from
metz
the
smiles
with
which
katherine
had
greeted
her
husbands
return
gave
place
to
tears
and
putting
her
hand
in
his
she
exclaimed
oh
gaspard
the
day
after
tomorrow
is
my
birthday
must
i
pass
it
without
you
our
general
tells
us
it
may
not
be
more
than
a
days
work
replied
gaspard
so
with
gods
blessing
i
may
be
with
you
and
may
bring
you
yet
a
birthday
present
only
return
safe
and
well
yourself
said
poor
katherine
and
i
shall
want
nothing
else
god
has
protected
us
so
far
dear
wife
returned
her
husband
let
us
put
our
trust
in
him
these
words
helped
to
restore
katherines
composure
and
wiping
away
her
tears
she
said
more
cheerfully—
now
you
must
want
your
supper
gaspard
as
well
as
the
children
so
saying
she
placed
what
she
had
prepared
on
the
rude
table
and
enjoyed
seeing
her
husband
and
little
ones
make
a
hearty
meal
soon
after
which
the
two
boys
knelt
and
said
their
evening
prayer
and
sang
their
little
hymn
of
praise
they
were
soon
asleep
equally
unconscious
of
the
hardships
of
the
present
or
the
dangers
of
the
future
it
was
late
ere
their
parents
retired
for
the
night
gaspard
was
busy
cleaning
his
arms
and
accoutrements
and
katherine
worked
by
his
side
by
an
early
hour
the
following
day
gaspard
was
ready
and
after
a
hasty
breakfast
he
took
a
tender
farewell
of
his
wife
and
children
though
he
well
knew
they
would
follow
him
to
where
the
troops
were
to
assemble
katherine
could
only
look
with
dread
at
the
military
display
before
her
but
the
two
little
boys
clapped
their
hands
with
delight
and
eagerly
watched
their
father
as
he
fell
into
his
place
in
the
regiment
to
which
he
belonged
the
order
to
march
was
soon
given
and
the
bands
struck
up
an
enlivening
strain
katherine
witnessed
their
departure
with
a
heavy
heart
and
when
she
could
no
longer
see
them
she
returned
sad
and
sorrowful
to
her
now
desolate
home
on
joining
the
spaniards
the
germans
found
they
were
under
the
orders
of
the
spanish
general
don
leva
who
had
taken
the
command
of
the
combined
force
they
were
soon
before
the
fortress
which
was
well
protected
by
high
and
massive
walls
deep
moats
and
strong
and
lofty
towers
judging
from
the
outward
appearance
of
the
fort
it
might
be
thought
capable
of
holding
out
for
at
least
a
time
against
any
attack
it
was
however
not
prepared
for
the
one
about
to
be
made
having
drawn
up
his
troops
in
readiness
for
an
assault
don
leva
despatched
a
summons
to
the
french
general
to
surrender
a
disdainful
answer
was
returned
the
spanish
chief
in
consequence
vowed
no
quarter
should
be
granted
to
those
who
had
thus
defied
him
he
ordered
an
immediate
attack
promising
the
soldiers
in
the
event
of
victory
that
all
should
be
given
up
to
them
that
the
fort
and
castle
contained
the
german
detachment
was
ordered
to
form
the
column
of
attack
gaspard
was
soon
foremost
amongst
the
combatants
his
regiment
performed
prodigies
of
valour
they
swam
the
moat
scaled
the
walls
and
after
pursuing
the
french
garrison
to
the
furthest
limits
of
the
fortress
they
returned
with
the
purpose
of
taking
possession
of
the
place
thus
evacuated
don
leva
arrested
their
triumphal
return
and
was
guilty
of
an
unpardonable
act
of
injustice
to
the
german
soldiers
the
spaniards
unfairly
claiming
the
honour
of
the
days
success
laid
claim
to
the
booty
resulting
from
it
their
commander
yielded
it
to
them
wholly
setting
aside
the
joint
right
of
the
germans
to
share
the
spoil
they
had
borne
the
first
dangers
of
the
assault
and
had
carried
all
before
them
and
whilst
engaged
in
pursuing
the
enemy
the
spaniards
entered
the
castle
laid
hands
on
all
they
could
find
and
spent
the
time
in
plundering
and
destroying
on
the
return
of
the
germans
they
were
ordered
by
don
leva
to
guard
the
different
approaches
to
the
castle
as
if
to
protect
those
who
were
so
shamelessly
pillaging
it
they
obeyed
but
with
mingled
feelings
of
anger
and
indignation
not
only
at
the
injustice
shown
to
them
but
at
the
excesses
and
rapacity
of
the
spanish
soldiers
gaspard
was
amongst
these
and
saw
with
vexation
many
pass
him
loaded
with
spoil
some
of
which
he
would
gladly
have
had
to
take
to
his
wife
and
children
the
spaniards
were
carrying
on
the
work
of
plunder
whilst
the
germans
fatigued
and
disappointed
were
gloomily
looking
on
when
suddenly
all
parties
were
startled
by
clouds
of
dense
smoke
arising
from
the
castle
within
the
fortress
quickly
followed
by
flames
which
soon
burst
forth
and
rose
high
above
the
smoke
whether
from
some
carelessness
on
the
part
of
the
spaniards
or
from
a
premeditated
act
on
that
of
the
vanquished
garrison
it
was
clear
that
the
castle
was
on
fire
the
terrible
element
soon
lit
up
the
whole
horizon
don
leva
knowing
the
place
to
be
of
some
importance
as
a
place
of
refuge
at
once
ordered
the
germans
to
endeavour
to
arrest
the
progress
of
the
fire
with
the
spirit
of
discipline
and
fidelity
for
which
they
were
remarkable
these
brave
soldiers
led
by
their
own
officers
rushed
to
obey
the
order
their
efforts
were
unavailing
the
devastating
element
made
rapid
progress
they
soon
found
it
was
hopeless
to
attempt
to
check
its
course
some
fled
from
the
burning
place
others
lingered
hoping
they
might
snatch
something
from
the
conflagration
whilst
some
few
advanced
into
the
doomed
building
to
see
if
there
were
any
in
it
whom
they
might
be
able
to
rescue
from
a
terrible
death
amongst
the
latter
was
gaspard
smoke
and
flames
met
him
as
he
advanced—still
he
pressed
on
after
passing
through
several
apartments
which
had
apparently
been
lately
stripped
of
all
that
once
adorned
them
he
came
to
a
smaller
one
which
had
not
yet
been
touched
by
the
fire
nor
by
the
rude
hands
of
the
plunderers
by
whom
it
had
probably
been
overlooked
it
was
however
richly
furnished
gaspard
looked
hastily
around
what
was
his
amazement
on
beholding
on
a
couch
a
child
sleeping
soundly
unconscious
of
the
danger
which
threatened
it
may
god
who
has
guided
me
here
enable
me
to
save
this
little
innocent
exclaimed
the
goodhearted
soldier
who
can
have
been
cruel
enough
to
leave
it
the
infant
appeared
scarcely
a
year
old
its
remarkable
beauty
struck
gaspard
even
in
that
moment
of
danger
he
raised
it
gently
from
the
couch
without
awaking
it
then
hastily
wrapping
it
in
a
large
mantle
which
had
been
thrown
over
it
he
fastened
it
securely
to
his
back
as
he
would
have
done
a
knapsack
he
then
set
to
work
to
retrace
his
steps
anxious
to
escape
ere
surrounded
by
the
devouring
element
which
he
was
well
aware
was
gaining
rapidly
upon
him
as
he
retraced
his
way
dense
smoke
threatened
to
suffocate
him
his
knees
shook
under
him
and
more
than
once
he
was
forced
to
stop
to
recover
himself
all
around
he
heard
the
crash
of
falling
beams
succeeded
by
fresh
bursts
of
flames
which
threw
a
fearful
glare
on
the
surrounding
objects
his
situation
was
one
of
extreme
peril
a
short
prayer
for
help
burst
from
his
lips
which
was
scarcely
uttered
ere
on
turning
suddenly
round
he
perceived
a
window
opening
on
to
a
stone
balcony
gaspard
rushed
to
it
and
found
it
was
no
great
height
from
the
ground
had
he
been
alone
he
would
at
once
have
leaped
from
it
as
was
he
proceeded
more
cautiously
and
having
his
arms
free
he
was
able
to
swing
himself
from
the
stone
balustrade
and
thus
diminish
the
height
he
had
to
fall
great
was
his
thankfulness
on
finding
himself
safe
with
his
little
charge
the
more
so
that
he
now
perceived
that
the
fire
was
gaining
rapidly
on
the
part
of
the
building
from
which
he
had
just
escaped
a
few
minutes
more
and
he
might
have
been
unable
to
gain
the
window
from
which
he
had
just
alighted
as
he
raised
himself
from
the
ground
the
little
infant
uttered
a
faint
cry
having
been
probably
awakened
by
the
fall
the
good
soldier
hastened
to
disencumber
it
of
its
wrappings
so
that
it
might
breathe
more
freely
the
little
creature
looked
at
its
preserver
and
smiled
seeming
in
no
way
alarmed
at
its
new
position
gaspard
having
opened
his
flask
of
light
wine
in
order
to
moisten
his
own
parched
lips
ventured
to
give
a
few
drops
to
the
child
feeling
sure
it
must
have
been
sometime
without
nourishment
he
then
again
carefully
folded
it
in
the
mantle
and
looked
around
to
see
how
he
could
best
find
his
way
back
to
his
comrades
at
this
moment
he
heard
the
trumpet
of
recall
and
the
wellknown
and
welcome
sound
guided
him
in
which
way
to
direct
his
steps
gaspard
hastened
to
obey
the
summons
on
rejoining
his
brave
companions
in
arms
he
found
it
somewhat
difficult
to
recognise
them
they
like
himself
were
disfigured
and
blackened
with
smoke
and
dirt
their
hair
and
beards
singed
and
scorched
gaspard
was
amongst
the
last
of
the
stragglers
and
his
appearance
was
heartily
welcomed
some
fears
having
been
entertained
for
his
safety
presently
a
cry
from
the
infant
he
had
rescued
attracted
the
notice
and
excited
the
curiosity
of
his
fellowsoldiers
gaspard
quietly
undid
the
bundle
he
carried
and
displayed
to
the
astonished
gaze
of
those
who
stood
around
the
beautiful
child
he
had
saved
a
shout
of
laughter
was
the
result
followed
by
such
exclamations
as—was
that
all
you
could
find
to
bring
away—i
would
have
had
something
better
than
that
for
my
trouble
there
were
others
however
who
did
silent
justice
to
the
courage
and
humanity
of
the
good
soldier
amongst
whom
was
his
captain
the
young
baron
otto
of
helfenstein
he
approached
the
group
and
listened
with
interest
to
gaspards
short
and
simple
account
of
his
finding
the
child
whom
it
was
easy
to
perceive
belonged
to
some
one
of
high
birth
its
clothes
were
of
the
finest
texture
and
richly
embroidered
whilst
the
fairness
of
its
complexion
and
the
beauty
of
its
golden
curls
showed
plainly
that
it
had
been
carefully
tended
the
young
baron
summoned
some
of
the
french
prisoners
in
the
hope
that
they
might
be
able
to
give
some
information
that
might
enable
him
to
discover
to
whom
the
poor
little
infant
belonged
but
he
could
learn
nothing
respecting
it
the
little
one
must
then
remain
with
its
preserver
said
the
baron
addressing
gaspard
till
we
can
trace
its
parents
but
you
have
already
a
wife
and
children
this
will
be
another
to
provide
for
you
must
let
me
help
you
and
your
good
wife
if
she
is
willing
to
take
charge
of
this
poor
little
one
gaspard
thanked
his
captain
with
tears
in
his
eyes
he
felt
more
grateful
for
his
approbation
than
for
his
promise
of
assistance
and
with
a
light
heart
he
resumed
his
precious
charge
the
order
to
march
was
soon
given
the
wearied
soldiers
gladly
obeyed
though
somewhat
dispirited
and
dissatisfied
with
the
days
work
gaspard
however
far
from
murmuring
was
thankful
for
his
preservation
as
well
as
for
that
of
the
little
being
who
he
now
hoped
might
through
the
barons
kindness
be
a
help
rather
than
a
burden
to
himself
and
his
wife
he
pleased
himself
by
imagining
the
surprise
with
which
katherine
would
receive
such
a
gift
for
her
birthday
knowing
her
tenderness
of
heart
he
felt
sure
of
a
welcome
for
the
little
foundling
and
that
she
would
readily
take
the
deserted
one
to
her
heart
the
day
was
drawing
to
a
close
when
the
regiment
reached
its
quarters
orders
for
the
morrow
having
been
issued
the
soldiers
were
at
liberty
to
return
each
to
his
own
hut
chapter
ii
the
birthday
gift
gaspard
was
hastening
away
with
the
rest
when
recalled
by
his
captain
who
placing
three
pieces
of
gold
in
his
hand
said
as
he
did
so—
my
friend
take
these
to
your
good
wife
with
the
new
charge
you
are
taking
to
her
and
tell
her
you
shall
never
want
a
friend
whilst
i
live
may
god
bless
you
my
noble
captain
exclaimed
gaspard
now
more
impatient
than
ever
to
reach
his
home
he
lost
no
time
in
repairing
thither
and
entered
it
with
a
light
heart
katherine
flew
to
meet
him
gaspard
she
cried
in
a
terrified
tone
gaspard
what
has
happened
you
are
all
black—your
hair
and
clothes
burnt—are
you
hurt—tell
me
tell
me
quick
it
is
nothing
dear
wife
i
am
not
hurt
but
i
have
had
to
defend
myself
not
only
against
the
enemy
but
a
terrible
fire
by
which
at
one
time
i
was
almost
surrounded
and
which
scorched
my
face
and
hands
as
you
see
and
blackened
me
from
head
to
foot
but
i
brought
away
a
birthday
present
for
you
katherine
which
i
hope
may
bring
a
blessing
with
it
so
saying
he
unfolded
the
mantle
and
displayed
to
his
wifes
astonished
eyes
the
lovely
infant
he
had
so
wonderfully
and
humanely
rescued
dear
husband
she
exclaimed
whose
is
it
and
where
did
you
find
it
then
taking
it
in
her
arms
she
tenderly
kissed
it
and
smoothed
its
fair
glossy
curls
gaspard
shortly
related
all
that
had
occurred—
the
danger
he
had
been
in
in
the
midst
of
the
burning
castle—the
finding
the
child—the
merciful
escape
he
had
had—and
finally
the
kind
promise
made
by
the
young
baron
otto
de
helfenstein
god
be
praised
said
katherine
when
her
husband
ceased
speaking
for
having
thus
preserved
you
and
this
little
one
from
such
fearful
peril
she
then
hastened
to
attend
to
the
poor
little
infant
who
had
been
so
cruelly
abandoned
she
undid
its
wrappings
washed
the
smoke
and
dust
from
its
face
and
hands
and
then
prepared
some
food
for
it
of
bread
and
goats
milk
whilst
thus
engaged
her
two
boys
rushed
into
the
hut
with
shouts
of
joy
having
heard
of
their
fathers
return—
michael
who
was
first
eagerly
asking
if
he
had
brought
them
anything
gaspard
smiling
pointed
to
the
child
on
his
mothers
lap
john
john
cried
the
boy
father
has
brought
back
our
little
brother
john
having
embraced
his
good
father
ran
to
look
as
michael
desired
yes
yes
said
he
our
little
francis
is
come
back
the
good
god
has
given
him
to
us
again
oh
what
pretty
blue
eyes
and
curling
hair
the
two
boys
kissed
the
child
thus
offering
to
it
the
love
they
had
for
their
little
brother
poor
katherines
tears
fell
fast
as
the
loss
of
her
little
one
was
thus
recalled
to
her
gaspard
suppressed
the
emotion
he
himself
felt
at
this
little
scene
and
seating
himself
by
his
wife
he
said—
yes
my
boys
this
little
one
shall
be
a
brother
to
you
and
your
good
mother
will
adopt
it
in
the
place
of
the
dear
one
we
lost
katherine
wiped
away
her
tears
and
laying
her
now
charge
on
one
of
their
rude
beds
with
the
two
boys
to
watch
it
she
hastened
to
prepare
the
meal
she
was
sure
her
husband
much
needed
the
evening
passed
happily
away
the
little
stranger
slept
as
soundly
on
katherines
humble
bed
as
on
the
rich
couch
on
which
gaspard
had
found
it
john
and
michael
soon
followed
its
example
and
then
katherine
had
leisure
to
seat
herself
by
her
husbands
side
and
talk
over
the
events
of
the
day
how
i
pity
that
poor
little
infants
parents
said
she
their
sorrow
must
be
greater
than
ours
when
we
lost
our
little
francis
we
knew
he
was
safe
with
god
whilst
they
cannot
know
what
has
become
of
their
little
one
i
wonder
if
any
marks
on
its
clothes
could
lead
to
any
trace
of
who
are
its
parents
but
though
its
linen
is
of
the
finest
sort
i
can
see
no
mark
but
look
gaspard
she
suddenly
added
at
this
cap
is
it
not
an
uncommon
one
it
was
in
truth
remarkable
not
only
for
the
fine
brussels
lace
of
which
it
was
made
but
more
so
from
there
being
a
star
embroidered
in
silver
on
the
right
side
look
at
this
star
continued
katherine
i
wonder
what
it
means
it
looks
as
if
the
child
is
of
noble
birth
said
her
husband
i
will
take
this
little
cap
tomorrow
to
the
baron
by
means
of
it
he
may
be
able
to
help
us
in
trying
to
discover
to
whom
this
poor
little
one
belongs
we
must
keep
it
carefully
replied
katherine
some
day
or
other
it
may
lead
to
some
discovery
the
husband
and
wife
were
long
in
talking
over
the
past
and
the
future
till
fatigue
at
last
compelled
them
to
seek
that
rest
which
gaspard
especially
much
needed
the
exciting
events
of
the
day
however
kept
the
weary
soldier
for
a
time
from
sleeping
but
at
last
he
slept
soundly
it
was
late
the
following
morning
ere
he
awoke
when
he
did
so
katherine
had
already
been
up
some
time
busily
occupied
in
her
household
work
it
was
the
birthday
so
much
thought
of
when
gaspard
joined
his
wife
outside
their
little
dwelling
he
took
both
her
hands
in
his
saying
as
he
did
so—dear
wife
we
must
thank
god
that
we
are
permitted
to
spend
this
day
together
and
ask
him
to
continue
to
protect
us
and
our
three
children
look
he
continued
showing
her
the
pieces
of
gold
he
had
received
from
his
captain
i
kept
them
till
today
that
i
might
be
able
to
give
you
some
little
help
as
well
as
pleasure
on
your
birthday
he
then
told
her
that
the
baron
had
given
him
this
money
as
a
pledge
of
what
he
would
do
for
the
little
foundling
which
had
been
so
singularly
thrown
on
their
hands
god
is
indeed
good
said
the
happy
katherine
her
heart
overflowing
with
joy
and
thankfulness
it
was
but
yesterday
that
i
changed
our
last
piece
of
money
to
procure
a
dinner
for
today
i
felt
sad
to
think
we
had
nothing
left
and
now
god
has
provided
for
us
well
dear
wife
you
may
now
prepare
a
good
dinner
i
shall
be
back
in
time
for
it
but
i
must
hasten
away
now
as
i
am
on
guard
this
morning
help
me
to
get
my
things
in
order
for
they
are
sadly
the
worse
for
yesterdays
rough
work
it
is
well
that
i
am
not
the
worse
myself
he
added
with
a
smile
as
he
affectionately
kissed
his
good
wife
katherine
quickly
left
what
she
was
doing
to
help
her
husband
and
whilst
so
engaged
she
asked
him
by
what
name
they
should
call
their
adopted
child
shall
we
call
it
francis
after
our
little
one
said
he
and
try
to
look
upon
it
as
indeed
our
own
the
good
woman
with
tears
in
her
eyes
readily
assented
and
taking
the
infant
in
her
arms
she
tenderly
kissed
it
saying
as
she
did
so—poor
little
one
i
will
love
you
for
my
little
francis
sake
gaspard
was
soon
ready
and
hastened
away
to
his
post
desiring
his
two
boys
to
help
their
mother
in
his
absence
the
day
so
happily
begun
did
not
pass
without
yet
further
cause
for
rejoicing
the
good
soldier
on
his
return
surprised
katherine
with
the
intelligence
that
he
was
promoted
to
the
rank
of
corporal
and
that
his
captain
had
before
the
whole
regiment
expressed
approbation
of
his
conduct
during
the
previous
day
not
only
when
engaged
in
the
assault
but
for
the
forbearance
and
humanity
he
had
displayed
afterwards
and
which
redounded
no
less
to
his
credit
than
his
courage
in
action
he
ended
by
holding
up
his
example
as
one
deserving
to
be
followed
by
his
fellowsoldiers
katherine
rejoiced
almost
more
over
this
tribute
to
her
husbands
worth
than
she
did
at
the
step
he
had
gained
the
men
had
also
received
their
arrears
of
pay
so
that
the
good
couple
now
felt
they
had
wherewithal
to
provide
for
the
future
for
some
time
to
come
they
retired
to
rest
that
night
with
hearts
filled
with
gratitude
for
the
mercies
they
had
received
in
this
world
however
unalloyed
happiness
is
the
lot
of
none
the
following
day
gaspard
returned
from
his
duty
sad
and
cast
down
the
cause
of
which
was
the
sudden
disappearance
of
his
young
captain
otto
de
helfenstein
it
was
not
known
whether
he
had
been
killed
by
some
skirmishing
party
of
the
enemys
or
made
prisoner
all
search
for
him
having
as
yet
proved
fruitless
the
whole
regiment
deplored
the
event
as
he
was
deservedly
beloved
by
the
men
under
his
command
gaspard
not
only
felt
deeply
the
loss
of
his
good
and
kind
captain
but
he
also
felt
that
in
him
their
little
foundling
would
lose
a
good
benefactor
the
child
would
now
be
thrown
wholly
on
their
care
the
poor
man
looked
anxiously
at
his
wife
fearing
she
might
regret
this
additional
burden
she
did
not
leave
him
long
in
doubt
gaspard
said
she
this
child
has
been
given
to
us—
we
will
look
upon
it
as
our
own—we
will
trust
to
god
to
provide
for
it
as
well
as
for
us
the
good
baron
may
yet
be
alive
but
if
not
we
will
do
our
best
yes
she
added
clasping
the
little
one
in
her
arms
you
shall
be
in
the
place
of
my
little
francis
dear
wife
exclaimed
gaspard
interrupting
her
i
ought
not
to
have
doubted
you
but
i
felt
halfafraid
i
had
added
to
your
cares
and
troubles
by
bringing
this
poor
little
one
to
you
no
no
cried
katherine
we
must
never
repent
of
doing
a
good
action—our
adopted
child
may
yet
bring
us
a
blessing
time
passed
on
gaspard
and
katherine
faithfully
fulfilling
the
duties
of
the
humble
position
in
which
god
had
placed
them
and
bringing
up
their
children
to
follow
their
example
in
the
midst
of
the
disasters
and
disturbances
of
war
they
lived
in
peace
and
happiness
in
their
little
home
the
good
soldier
had
vainly
endeavoured
to
trace
the
parents
of
the
little
francis
and
had
at
last
given
up
the
search
nothing
had
been
heard
of
the
young
baron
otto
de
helfenstein
the
siege
of
metz
still
continued
the
emperor
charles
v
being
determined
to
regain
it
at
any
price
it
was
however
useless
the
town
was
strongly
fortified
and
well
garrisoned
and
was
bravely
defended
by
the
duke
of
guise
the
approach
of
winter
and
the
increasing
scarcity
of
provisions
together
with
sickness
and
mortality
amongst
the
troops
at
last
induced
the
emperor
to
abandon
the
enterprise
and
accordingly
the
army
was
withdrawn
in
january
gaspard
was
sent
with
his
regiment
to
anvers
and
from
thence
to
the
beautiful
town
of
strasburg
the
good
soldier
and
his
family
stood
greatly
in
need
of
rest
and
quiet
they
bail
suffered
much
from
the
hardships
and
privations
of
a
campaign
though
they
had
been
spared
all
serious
illness
gaspard
had
served
eighteen
years
and
had
fought
in
many
battles
in
germany
italy
and
hungary
he
now
longed
for
repose
katherine
was
still
more
anxious
than
her
husband
for
a
quiet
home
she
urged
him
to
leave
the
army
and
to
adopt
some
other
means
of
obtaining
a
livelihood
they
often
pictured
to
themselves
the
happiness
of
being
able
to
settle
in
their
beloved
suabia
where
so
many
happy
years
had
been
passed
and
which
seemed
to
them
as
a
haven
of
rest
but
alas
with
all
their
care
they
had
been
unable
to
save
enough
to
purchase
even
the
smallest
piece
of
land
or
the
poorest
cottage
so
that
gaspard
still
remained
undecided
as
to
the
future
it
was
however
provided
for
by
one
who
overrules
every
event
and
orders
all
for
the
best
gaspard
received
the
unlookedfor
intelligence
of
a
small
property
being
left
him
by
a
distant
relation
of
his
wifes
sufficient
from
what
he
heard
to
maintain
his
family
in
honest
comfort
great
was
the
joy
and
thankfulness
of
the
good
soldier
and
his
wife
at
being
thus
provided
for
gaspard
applied
immediately
for
his
discharge
which
was
readily
granted
he
retired
from
the
army
in
which
he
had
served
so
many
years
with
many
tokens
of
approbation
from
those
who
had
witnessed
not
only
his
courage
in
action
but
his
uniform
steadiness
and
good
conduct
gaspard
was
not
long
in
making
the
necessary
preparations
for
the
journey
he
bought
a
tilted
cart
and
horse
to
convey
the
little
party
and
such
articles
of
furniture
as
they
were
unwilling
to
part
with
the
arms
he
had
so
long
borne
with
honour
his
favourite
bearskin
and
the
cross
before
which
they
had
so
often
knelt
in
prayer
on
a
beautiful
morning
in
the
month
of
may
gaspard
katherine
and
their
three
children
quitted
strasburg—katherine
seated
in
the
cart
with
francis
on
her
lap
michael
and
john
by
her
side
whilst
gaspard
drove
the
weather
continued
fine
and
the
travellers
reached
suabia
without
an
accident
of
any
kind
all
was
new
to
the
two
boys
and
they
were
delighted
with
the
many
towns
and
villages
through
which
they
passed
the
small
property
left
to
gaspard
was
near
feldsberg
seated
on
the
river
joya
the
castle
and
large
domain
around
was
the
property
of
one
of
those
rich
and
powerful
nobles
who
in
those
days
exercised
almost
sovereign
sway
not
only
over
those
actually
dependent
on
them
but
on
all
who
were
unable
to
dispute
their
will
or
resist
their
tyranny
the
count
de
sternfelden
the
rich
possessor
of
the
castle
and
domain
of
feldsberg
seldom
visited
it
having
other
and
apparently
more
attractive
places
of
residence
the
management
therefore
of
this
vast
estate
was
entrusted
to
a
steward
who
had
made
himself
feared
as
well
as
hated
by
his
pride
injustice
and
avarice
and
the
harshness
with
which
he
treated
all
over
whom
he
had
any
power
gaspard
troubled
himself
little
about
the
character
given
him
by
the
neighbours
of
the
man
under
whom
he
was
to
hold
his
little
property
he
had
served
for
the
last
six
years
under
one
of
the
strictest
colonels
in
the
army
and
had
never
incurred
his
displeasure
he
believed
therefore
that
by
honestly
paying
the
taxes
and
conducting
himself
as
a
good
vassal
of
the
lord
of
the
domain
he
would
have
nothing
to
fear
the
little
farm
left
to
gaspard
was
pleasantly
situated
at
a
short
distance
from
the
village
of
feldsberg
the
house
was
small
but
comfortable
surrounded
by
a
garden
well
stocked
with
fruittrees
near
the
house
or
rather
cottage
ran
a
clear
stream
which
bounded
some
meadows
also
belonging
to
gaspard
full
of
hope
and
thankfulness
the
good
soldier
and
his
family
took
possession
of
their
new
home
with
the
little
money
gaspard
had
saved
a
cow
was
bought
the
horse
was
likely
to
be
too
useful
to
be
parted
with
michael
and
john
were
old
enough
to
help
their
father
in
cultivating
the
land
and
garden
whilst
katherine
undertook
the
care
of
the
poultryyard
an
occupation
in
which
the
little
francis
was
her
constant
companion
a
blessing
seemed
to
attend
their
labours
so
that
the
good
couple
hoped
after
a
time
to
be
able
to
give
their
boys
some
education
contenting
themselves
for
the
present
with
such
as
they
were
themselves
able
to
give
in
their
hours
of
leisure
four
years
passed
happily
away
and
in
that
time
gaspard
and
his
family
had
gained
the
respect
and
goodwill
of
their
neighbours
whom
they
were
ever
ready
to
help
in
any
way
in
their
power
the
steward
had
never
troubled
them
though
the
overbearing
insolence
of
his
manner
towards
all
who
were
in
any
way
dependent
on
him
had
occasionally
tried
gaspards
patience
and
forbearance
chapter
iii
adversity
days
of
trial
were
now
approaching
a
bad
season
caused
the
produce
of
the
land
and
garden
to
fail
poor
gaspard
was
obliged
to
sell
the
cow
to
pay
the
taxes
this
sacrifice
was
made
without
a
murmur
he
and
his
wife
knew
from
whom
the
trial
came
and
patiently
submitted
still
putting
their
trust
in
one
who
had
never
yet
forsaken
them
this
trouble
was
followed
by
another
gaspard
fell
ill
and
was
unable
to
work
katherines
time
was
taken
up
in
attendance
on
her
husband
so
that
the
poultryyard
was
neglected
and
want
and
distress
threatened
to
take
the
place
of
the
ease
and
comfort
in
which
the
little
family
had
hitherto
lived
poor
katherine
was
forced
to
incur
debts
to
procure
what
was
necessary
for
her
husband
the
winter
season
was
approaching
and
there
appeared
to
be
but
little
prospect
of
their
being
able
to
pay
the
taxes
which
they
knew
would
be
rigorously
exacted
gaspard
and
his
wife
endeavoured
to
cheer
and
encourage
each
other
but
at
times
their
hearts
ached
and
their
spirits
sank
at
the
prospect
before
them
it
was
now
the
month
of
october
and
for
the
first
time
for
many
many
months
gaspard
was
able
to
go
in
the
little
tilted
cart
to
the
neighbouring
town
for
some
things
of
which
his
family
stood
in
need
michael
and
john
accompanied
their
father
the
little
francis
remaining
alone
with
katherine
who
devoted
the
day
to
washing
and
repairing
such
things
as
she
had
not
had
leisure
to
attend
to
during
her
husbands
illness
on
opening
a
press
to
take
out
some
articles
of
linen
which
had
lain
by
some
time
francis
little
cap
caught
her
eye
it
had
become
somewhat
discoloured
by
lying
by
though
the
star
retained
its
lustre
she
took
it
out
and
placed
it
apart
on
the
table
with
the
intention
of
getting
rid
first
of
such
articles
as
would
require
more
time
and
care
whilst
thus
busily
occupied
katherine
was
startled
by
a
loud
clap
of
thunder
which
was
quickly
followed
by
another
and
then
the
rain
came
down
in
torrents
accompanied
by
vivid
flashes
of
lightning
poor
katherine
trembled
for
her
husband
and
children
and
was
anxiously
watching
for
any
sign
of
the
storm
abating
when
the
door
of
the
cottage
was
hastily
opened
and
a
lady
richly
dressed
entered
katherine
perceived
at
once
that
it
was
the
wife
of
the
dreaded
steward
will
you
give
me
shelter
till
the
storm
is
over
she
asked
willingly
madam
replied
katherine
i
wish
i
had
been
better
prepared
to
receive
you
she
then
hastened
to
offer
her
best
chair
to
her
visitor
and
carefully
wiped
the
wet
from
her
dress
and
mantle
the
little
francis
soon
attracted
the
ladys
attention
is
that
beautiful
child
yours
she
inquired
he
is
not
a
bit
like
you
but
what
have
you
there
she
added
addressing
the
boy
who
was
playing
with
the
little
cap
his
attention
having
been
caught
by
the
star
katherine
desired
the
child
to
go
and
show
it
to
the
lady
the
lace
is
beautiful
she
observed
where
did
you
get
it
and
what
this
silver
star
mean
katherine
was
by
no
means
pleased
at
being
thus
rudely
questioned
nor
was
she
inclined
to
satisfy
her
visitors
curiosity
she
therefore
replied
shortly
that
it
had
come
into
her
husbands
possession
during
the
siege
of
metz
and
that
he
had
given
it
to
her
well
said
the
lady
it
can
be
of
no
use
to
you
i
should
like
it
for
my
youngest
child
i
will
give
you
any
price
you
like
to
ask
for
it
madam
replied
katherine
we
value
this
little
cap
and
cannot
part
with
it
indeed
we
ought
not
to
do
so
my
good
woman
interrupted
the
lady
angrily
this
cap
can
be
of
no
use
to
you—i
desire
to
have
it
you
will
do
well
to
consider
before
you
refuse
me
she
was
well
aware
of
the
troubles
which
had
lately
come
upon
gaspard
and
his
family
and
believed
that
they
would
in
consequence
be
afraid
of
offending
her
poor
katherine
was
now
much
distressed
she
knew
full
well
the
power
the
steward
possessed
of
injuring
them
and
yet
she
was
firm
in
her
determination
of
not
parting
with
the
cap
madam
said
she
clasping
her
hands
as
if
in
entreaty
i
will
do
anything
else
to
oblige
you
but
i
cannot
part
with
that
cap—pardon
me
for
refusing
the
lady
rose
angrily
and
throwing
the
cap
on
the
ground
she
said—you
shall
pay
dear
for
this
insolence
and
without
giving
katherine
time
to
reply
indignantly
left
the
cottage
in
spite
of
the
rain
which
still
fell
heavily
katherine
sank
on
a
seat
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
wept
bitterly
she
knew
she
had
acted
rightly
but
naturally
feared
the
consequences
if
only
her
husband
had
been
at
home
she
would
have
felt
less
cast
down
poor
little
francis
clung
to
her
endeavouring
by
his
childish
caresses
to
comfort
her
though
unable
to
comprehend
the
cause
of
her
grief
he
picked
up
the
little
cap
and
laid
it
on
her
lap
and
then
laid
his
own
fair
head
upon
it
katherine
placed
her
hand
fondly
on
the
bright
curls
though
her
tears
still
fell
fast
it
was
not
long
before
gaspard
and
his
two
boys
returned
they
had
luckily
obtained
shelter
during
the
storm
on
learning
the
cause
of
his
wifes
distress
the
poor
man
though
equally
fearing
the
consequences
which
might
result
from
what
had
occurred
at
once
reassured
her
by
saying—
dear
wife
whatever
may
happen
you
have
done
right
we
must
keep
that
cap
it
alone
can
ever
lead
to
any
discovery
of
the
parents
of
our
little
francis
we
should
do
wrong
to
part
with
it
gaspard
knew
well
they
had
little
to
hope
from
the
stewards
clemency
still
he
would
not
seek
to
please
him
or
his
wife
at
the
risk
of
injuring
their
adopted
child
time
passed
on
but
a
few
days
remained
in
which
to
make
up
the
amount
of
the
taxes
and
gaspard
had
not
a
third
of
the
sum
required
he
knew
not
how
to
obtain
it
meanwhile
the
stewards
wife
exerted
all
her
influence
to
exasperate
her
husband
against
gaspard
relating
what
had
occurred
when
she
was
driven
to
take
shelter
in
his
cottage
and
falsely
accusing
katherine
of
insolence
and
rudeness
she
wickedly
resolved
to
wreak
her
vengeance
on
the
unhappy
family
and
to
obtain
by
force
what
she
could
not
possess
herself
of
in
any
justifiable
way
she
succeeded
but
too
well—her
husband
ever
ready
to
exercise
his
arbitrary
power
summoned
gaspard
to
pay
the
taxes
due
threatening
at
the
same
time
to
seize
his
goods
if
he
did
not
pay
at
the
given
time
the
day
before
the
one
appointed
arrived
and
at
the
last
moment
poor
gaspard
set
out
to
endeavour
to
borrow
even
a
part
of
the
sum
required
from
a
farmer
with
whom
he
had
had
some
dealings
he
went
with
a
heavy
heart
and
with
but
faint
hopes
of
success
still
he
would
not
leave
a
chance
untried
night
came
and
gaspard
did
not
appear
poor
katherine
knew
not
what
to
think
had
he
met
with
any
one
likely
to
help
him
or
had
he
fallen
ill
whilst
seeking
for
assistance
the
night
was
passed
in
too
great
anxiety
for
the
poor
woman
to
be
able
to
sleep
and
she
anxiously
watched
for
the
return
of
day
alas
it
only
brought
fresh
trouble
to
the
once
happy
home
the
steward
himself
appeared
peremptorily
demanded
the
money
due
to
his
lord
overwhelmed
the
terrified
katherine
with
reproaches
for
her
conduct
to
his
wife
and
refused
in
consequence
to
grant
any
delay
or
even
to
await
gaspards
return
he
failed
not
to
carry
out
his
cruel
purpose
he
had
scarcely
left
the
cottage
ere
a
bailiff
and
his
men
entered
it—they
were
plainly
at
hand
ready
to
do
the
stewards
bidding
these
men
at
once
laid
a
distress
upon
all
the
house
contained
in
the
name
of
the
count
de
sternfelden
the
unhappy
katherine
was
too
much
frightened
and
overcome
by
this
barbarous
violence
to
offer
the
slightest
resistance
she
saw
herself
and
family
suddenly
and
unjustly
despoiled
of
all
that
had
been
acquired
by
years
of
labour
and
economy
pale
and
trembling
she
leant
against
the
wall
watching
the
road
by
which
gaspard
would
return
with
michael
and
john
who
had
accompanied
him
little
francis
clung
to
her
asking
why
their
beds
tables
and
even
clothes
were
being
taken
away
the
poor
little
fellow
cried
bitterly
when
he
saw
his
own
little
cap
seized
upon
with
the
rest
the
little
cap
which
had
been
so
carefully
treasured
in
the
fond
hope
that
it
might
some
day
benefit
their
adopted
child
if
not
themselves
seemed
to
be
one
cause
of
the
heavy
calamity
which
had
now
come
upon
them
in
the
midst
of
this
sad
scene
gaspard
and
his
two
boys
entered
their
hitherto
quiet
home
the
poor
man
had
been
unable
to
obtain
any
assistance
but
returned
with
the
hope
that
he
might
at
least
be
granted
a
little
longer
time
in
which
to
raise
the
sum
required
great
therefore
was
his
dismay
and
surprise
at
finding
his
home
halfstripped
of
its
contents
and
katherine
and
the
little
francis
weeping
bitterly
the
sight
of
her
husband
seemed
to
arouse
katherine
from
the
state
of
terror
and
despair
in
which
he
found
her
leaning
on
his
arm
for
support
she
related
to
him
all
that
had
occurred
during
his
absence
the
poor
man
gave
way
to
a
burst
of
anger
and
indignation
katherine
he
exclaimed
whilst
tears
started
from
his
eyes
such
wickedness
cannot
go
unpunished
i
will
seek
the
count
were
it
even
to
the
end
of
the
world
and
demand
justice
i
will
denounce
the
man
who
so
cruelly
oppresses
all
over
whom
he
has
any
power
poor
katherine
wept
silently
on
her
husbands
shoulder
oh
gaspard
said
she
what
will
become
of
us
without
a
home
without
bread
almost
without
clothes
winter
approaching
and
no
one
to
befriend
us
gaspard
was
now
more
composed
dear
wife
said
he
putting
his
arm
fondly
around
her
take
courage
we
must
not
despair
amidst
the
dangers
and
horrors
of
war
god
has
always
protected
us
he
will
do
so
still
he
will
not
forsake
those
who
trust
in
him
the
unhappy
couple
then
seated
themselves
on
one
of
the
few
seats
left
them
to
consider
what
they
could
do
to
alleviate
their
present
destitute
condition
and
to
provide
for
the
future
they
had
never
before
found
themselves
without
a
home
or
the
means
of
subsistence
gaspard
was
firmly
resolved
to
seek
the
count
and
proposed
that
his
eldest
boy
should
accompany
him
whilst
katherine
with
the
two
other
boys
might
endeavour
to
obtain
a
temporary
shelter
with
a
sister
of
his
who
he
believed
was
settled
at
ponnering
a
town
at
no
great
distance
from
feldsberg
whilst
considering
this
project
some
one
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
now
desolate
dwelling
on
opening
it
dame
christine
a
good
and
kind
neighbour
for
whom
katherine
had
done
many
kind
services
entered
god
of
mercy
she
cried
as
she
cast
a
look
of
dismay
around
the
halfdismantled
room
it
is
then
true
and
that
bad
man
has
done
this
cruel
deed
katherine
was
unable
to
reply
yes
good
neighbour
said
gaspard
it
is
indeed
true
he
has
deprived
us
of
everything—we
cannot
remain
here
he
then
explained
to
christine
his
project
of
seeking
the
count
to
inform
him
of
the
stewards
harsh
conduct
towards
himself
as
well
as
the
oppression
complained
of
by
all
on
the
estate
dame
christine
listened
with
much
interest
and
warmly
approved
of
gaspards
intention
saying
it
was
time
the
count
should
be
made
aware
of
the
frequent
acts
of
oppression
and
injustice
committed
in
his
name
the
good
woman
then
insisted
on
gaspard
and
his
family
taking
shelter
in
her
cottage
cordially
offering
to
share
all
she
had
with
them
she
was
sure
they
required
not
only
food
but
rest
and
would
take
no
denial
katherine
clasped
the
kind
womans
hands
to
express
her
gratitude
whilst
gaspard
said
with
tears
in
his
eyes—
you
see
we
are
not
forsaken
go
with
our
good
neighbour
i
will
follow
you
quickly
but
i
will
see
the
steward
first
katherine
would
have
dissuaded
her
husband
from
this
but
he
was
firm
in
his
purpose
and
at
once
started
for
the
castle
on
arriving
there
he
was
shown
into
the
presence
of
the
steward
he
was
sitting
in
an
apartment
as
richly
furnished
as
if
it
had
been
occupied
by
the
count
himself
what
is
your
business
he
haughtily
inquired
as
gaspard
entered
i
come
to
demand
justice
said
gaspard
sternly
you
are
placed
here
to
protect
the
noble
counts
rights
and
property
not
to
commit
acts
of
cruel
injustice
you
have
seized
my
goods
my
land
and
dwelling
they
are
worth
ten
times
the
sum
i
owe
neither
the
tears
nor
the
prayers
of
my
wife
moved
you
to
show
us
any
mercy
you
have
deprived
us
of
food
clothes
and
shelter
all
this
you
have
done
to
show
your
power
and
to
gratify
your
wifes
desire
for
revenge
i
now
tell
you
that
i
go
to
seek
the
count
your
lord
as
well
as
mine
if
necessary
i
will
follow
him
from
place
to
place
till
i
can
tell
him
not
only
of
your
treatment
of
me
but
of
many
others
who
have
been
hardly
dealt
with
so
saying
and
without
awaiting
a
reply
gaspard
quitted
the
room
the
steward
had
listened
in
mute
astonishment
no
one
had
ever
so
addressed
and
threatened
him
before
he
was
half
inclined
to
summon
an
attendant
and
to
desire
that
gaspard
should
be
recalled
his
pride
however
forbade
that
he
would
not
condescend
to
dispute
with
one
who
had
so
braved
and
outraged
him
at
the
same
time
he
dreaded
lest
gaspard
should
put
his
threat
into
execution
and
make
his
conduct
known
to
the
count
for
some
time
he
paced
the
room
uncertain
how
to
act
but
at
last
quieted
his
fears
with
the
belief
that
gaspard
would
not
carry
out
his
purpose
and
if
he
does
he
exclaimed
aloud
i
need
not
fear
he
will
not
be
believed
my
wifes
sister
who
was
one
of
the
countesss
women
will
be
there
to
deny
any
tale
against
me
meanwhile
poor
gaspard
rejoined
his
wife
and
children
at
the
good
christines
who
had
done
what
she
could
for
the
comfort
of
those
whom
she
had
so
hospitably
sheltered
after
the
trying
events
of
the
day
all
were
glad
to
retire
early
to
rest
gaspard
and
katherine
decided
ere
they
did
so
on
setting
out
the
next
day
so
as
not
to
trespass
longer
than
necessary
on
their
good
neighbours
kindness
chapter
iv
gaspard
and
his
family
leave
their
home
the
following
morning
they
were
up
by
daybreak
in
order
to
prepare
for
their
sad
journey
gaspard
fortunately
recollected
that
one
thing
which
might
now
be
of
essential
service
to
them
had
either
been
overlooked
or
not
considered
of
sufficient
value
to
have
been
taken
this
was
a
donkey
which
his
boys
used
for
such
small
jobs
as
they
were
able
to
do
about
the
place
and
a
day
seldom
passed
without
pedro
as
they
called
it
having
his
full
share
of
labour
and
by
the
boys
pedro
was
as
much
prized
as
anything
they
possessed
great
was
their
joy
when
their
father
said
he
would
gladly
take
it
with
them
he
knew
it
would
spare
much
fatigue
to
his
wife
and
boys
it
will
easily
be
believed
that
it
cost
our
little
party
many
a
pang
to
leave
their
home
and
to
part
with
all
they
cared
for
the
cross
alone
remained
to
them
and
this
gaspard
committed
to
the
care
of
the
good
christine
with
the
hope
that
he
might
one
day
be
able
to
reclaim
it
for
the
last
time
he
and
his
little
family
knelt
before
it
and
implored
from
god
the
help
and
protection
they
so
much
needed
as
well
as
strength
to
enable
them
to
submit
with
resignation
to
whatever
might
be
appointed
for
them
in
some
measure
cheered
and
comforted
by
this
act
of
devotion
the
poor
soldier
accompanied
by
his
family
set
out
on
their
sorrowful
pilgrimage
well
provided
by
their
kind
hostess
with
such
provisions
as
she
was
able
to
spare
as
well
as
with
a
small
sum
of
money
which
gaspard
accepted
in
the
hope
of
being
able
some
day
to
repay
it
he
could
not
but
believe
that
his
little
property
would
be
restored
to
him
they
now
found
themselves
wandering
they
scarce
knew
whither
very
different
was
this
journey
to
the
last
they
were
then
going
joyfully
to
take
possession
of
a
home
unexpectedly
given
to
them
they
were
now
turned
adrift
from
that
same
home
and
knew
not
whether
they
should
ever
behold
it
again
gaspard
knew
that
the
count
de
sternfelden
had
two
or
three
other
estates
and
that
he
resided
sometimes
at
one
and
sometimes
at
another
he
learnt
that
he
had
lately
been
residing
at
his
castle
of
sternfelden
near
mayence
and
it
was
there
that
gaspard
hoped
to
find
him
gaspards
first
object
was
to
reach
the
town
of
ponnering
about
four
days
journey
from
feldsberg
and
where
he
believed
he
had
a
sister
living
but
of
whom
he
had
heard
nothing
for
some
years
save
that
during
the
time
he
was
actively
engaged
with
the
army
she
had
married
and
settled
in
ponnering
he
was
ignorant
of
her
present
name
as
no
letter
from
her
had
ever
reached
him
though
he
had
accidentally
learnt
that
she
had
married
a
cabinetmaker
and
was
in
good
circumstances
he
hoped
therefore
that
by
personal
inquiries
he
might
be
able
to
make
her
out
feeling
sure
that
could
he
do
so
he
would
be
readily
welcomed
believing
that
neither
time
nor
silence
would
in
any
way
have
diminished
the
affection
that
once
subsisted
between
them
to
ponnering
therefore
the
little
party
directed
their
steps
the
hope
of
finding
a
friend
there
cheered
them
on
their
way
and
helped
to
lighten
the
fears
and
anxieties
which
gaspard
and
his
wife
could
not
but
feel
at
the
undertaking
before
them
had
our
brave
soldier
been
alone
he
would
have
feared
nothing
he
only
dreaded
fatigue
and
hardship
for
the
dear
ones
who
were
accompanying
him
he
therefore
clung
to
the
hope
that
if
he
could
but
discover
his
sister
they
might
obtain
shelter
under
her
roof
whilst
he
pursued
his
way
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
the
count
and
putting
before
him
his
sad
case
and
the
cruel
injustice
with
which
he
had
been
treated
and
which
he
well
knew
the
count
would
never
otherwise
be
informed
of
the
poor
travellers
on
first
starting
trusted
to
the
wellknown
hospitality
of
their
countrymen
and
neither
food
nor
shelter
were
ever
denied
them
such
kind
help
in
some
measure
lightened
the
fatigue
and
hardship
of
their
weary
journey
on
reaching
the
small
town
of
ponnering
gaspard
resolved
without
delay
to
seek
his
sister
but
not
caring
to
take
his
wife
and
children
with
hire
or
to
subject
them
to
wandering
about
the
streets
of
a
strange
town
he
entered
a
barn
in
a
field
adjoining
the
road
and
ventured
to
leave
them
in
it
whilst
he
went
to
see
if
he
could
obtain
tidings
of
his
sister—hoping
if
he
did
so
soon
to
fetch
them
to
a
temporary
home
with
some
trouble
and
no
little
difficulty
gaspard
obtained
the
information
he
wanted
and
proceeded
at
once
to
where
he
trusted
to
find
a
sister
from
whom
by
circumstances
he
had
been
long
parted
what
then
was
his
consternation
on
finding
that
she
had
been
left
a
widow
and
had
lately
died
and
that
having
had
no
children
the
property
and
business
had
gone
to
her
husbands
brother
on
learning
this
sad
news
poor
gaspards
heart
sank
within
him
he
felt
not
for
himself
but
for
his
wife
and
children
the
eldest
barely
twelve
years
old
winter
had
now
set
in
snow
was
already
whitening
the
ground
and
he
knew
not
where
or
how
to
provide
a
shelter
for
them
he
returned
with
a
heavy
heart
to
katherine
the
poor
woman
bore
the
intelligence
better
than
he
expected
she
had
dreaded
being
separated
from
her
husband
and
but
for
her
children
would
never
have
consented
to
being
so
there
seemed
now
no
alternative
and
in
reply
to
her
husbands
inquiry
as
to
what
was
to
be
done
she
said
firmly
and
resolutely—dear
gaspard
i
will
go
with
you
we
will
not
be
separated
we
have
shared
every
danger
we
will
share
this
one
with
tears
the
poor
man
thanked
her
for
this
fresh
proof
of
love
and
devotion
he
had
much
disliked
parting
from
her
and
his
boys
he
felt
that
with
them
and
for
their
sakes
he
could
brave
anything
and
willingly
encounter
any
hardship
the
day
was
now
too
near
its
close
for
the
poor
travellers
to
think
of
resuming
their
journey
gaspard
therefore
sought
the
owner
of
the
barn
to
ask
leave
to
occupy
it
for
the
night
this
was
readily
granted
and
the
weary
ones
thankfully
accepted
the
rude
shelter
all
was
however
clean
heaps
of
straw
and
piles
of
sacks
halffilled
the
barn
and
of
these
they
made
use
and
found
they
made
no
bad
beds
poor
pedro
was
safely
tethered
outside
after
a
meal
of
such
provisions
as
they
had
with
the
addition
of
some
milk
kindly
given
them
by
the
farmers
wife
they
sought
the
repose
so
much
needed
and
soon
slept
as
soundly
as
they
would
have
done
on
softer
couches
the
next
day
however
brought
a
fresh
trouble
john
was
too
unwell
to
admit
of
the
journey
being
resumed
the
poor
little
fellow
could
scarcely
raise
his
head
from
the
rude
couch
on
which
he
lay
in
this
unlookedfor
difficulty
gaspard
again
sought
the
farmer
who
not
only
gave
ready
permission
for
them
to
remain
where
they
were
saying
he
had
no
present
use
for
the
barn
but
promised
to
send
such
little
assistance
as
they
might
require
his
good
wife
was
readily
interested
in
the
little
party
and
felt
for
their
distress
so
sure
it
is
that
help
in
some
shape
or
other
comes
when
most
needed
from
one
who
never
wholly
forsakes
those
who
are
his
gaspard
gratefully
endeavoured
to
repay
the
good
farmers
kindness
by
doing
such
work
as
he
was
capable
of
and
he
and
michael
were
daily
helping
at
the
farm
whilst
katherine
tended
the
sick
child
and
the
little
francis
a
few
days
rest
and
care
sufficed
to
restore
the
boy
and
with
grateful
and
heartfelt
thanks
the
poor
soldier
and
his
family
prepared
to
leave
the
kind
friends
and
that
shelter
which
had
been
so
readily
afforded
them
and
though
pressed
to
remain
they
dared
not
delay
as
the
season
was
getting
daily
more
inclement
and
they
were
therefore
anxious
to
press
on
ere
it
became
more
severe
the
following
day
gaspard
and
his
family
resumed
their
toilsome
journey
snow
now
covered
the
mountains
and
already
lay
deep
in
the
valleys
the
sky
was
overcast
and
a
keen
wind
blew
against
which
the
clothing
of
the
poor
travellers
but
ill
protected
them
they
were
sometimes
unable
to
obtain
shelter
at
night
save
what
a
miserable
barn
or
shed
afforded
them
added
to
these
hardships
it
was
not
always
that
they
could
get
sufficient
food
and
the
effects
of
hunger
cold
and
fatigue
were
now
being
severely
felt
especially
by
poor
katherine
whose
strength
was
daily
diminishing
and
which
her
husband
noticed
with
no
little
anxiety
the
more
so
that
the
poor
donkey
had
fallen
lame
and
was
therefore
but
of
little
use
to
them
and
this
materially
retarded
their
progress
being
now
in
a
part
of
the
country
but
thinly
inhabited
they
could
no
longer
meet
with
the
hospitality
which
had
lightened
the
trials
of
the
first
part
of
their
journey
the
evening
of
the
ninth
day
when
the
snow
was
falling
fast
around
them
and
the
hearts
of
the
poor
wanderers
sank
within
them
at
the
prospect
of
passing
the
night
without
food
or
shelter
a
peasant
overtook
them
as
he
was
going
to
call
in
his
goats
from
the
hills
too
thankful
were
they
to
accept
the
good
mans
ready
offer
of
shelter
for
the
night
in
his
humble
cottage
help
was
thus
once
again
sent
at
their
utmost
need
and
fervently
did
they
return
thanks
for
it
ere
they
retired
to
rest
that
night
to
poor
katherine
it
was
most
welcome
their
spirits
were
still
further
revived
by
learning
from
their
kind
host
who
had
not
only
afforded
them
shelter
but
such
food
as
he
was
able
to
supply
that
they
were
only
two
leagues
from
sternfelden
and
that
the
count
was
at
his
castle
there
there
was
still
a
weary
walk
for
the
exhausted
party
as
they
resolved
to
leave
pedro
with
the
good
peasant
he
was
too
lame
to
be
of
any
further
use
to
them
and
it
would
have
been
cruel
to
use
the
poor
beast
further
they
were
therefore
glad
to
leave
it
in
good
hands
the
peasant
promised
to
take
every
care
of
it
which
in
some
degree
reconciled
the
boys
to
the
loss
of
their
favourite
cheered
and
encouraged
by
the
prospect
of
reaching
sternfelden
they
started
early
the
following
day
they
were
told
they
had
a
valley
and
mountain
between
them
and
their
journeys
end
but
they
did
not
now
despair
of
reaching
it
the
fatigue
however
seemed
almost
beyond
poor
katherines
strength
and
ere
they
had
reached
the
summit
of
the
mountain
by
the
rugged
path
which
led
over
it
she
sank
exhausted
on
the
ground
gaspard
she
said
i
can
go
no
further
leave
me
and
go
on
with
the
children
my
poor
wife
said
he
whilst
tears
ran
down
his
pale
wan
face
we
are
near
our
journeys
end
rest
for
a
while
we
will
then
try
to
go
on
oh
surely
our
troubles
will
soon
end
katherine
seemed
unable
to
reply
but
leant
against
her
husband
who
had
seated
himself
by
her
as
if
to
support
her
whilst
poor
little
francis
put
his
cold
hands
round
her
neck
and
kissed
away
the
tears
which
now
fell
fast
saying
as
he
did
so
do
not
cry
dear
good
mother
we
shall
soon
get
home
god
will
lead
us
there
yes
yes
dear
child
exclaimed
gaspard
raising
his
eyes
to
heaven
you
are
right
it
is
six
years
this
very
day
since
i
saved
you
from
death
tomorrow
is
your
poor
mothers
birthday
oh
let
us
still
hope
that
god
will
be
merciful
to
us
now
as
he
was
then
he
had
scarcely
uttered
these
words
when
the
distant
sound
of
church
bells
struck
on
the
ears
of
the
little
party
listen
listen
father
exclaimed
the
boys
almost
with
one
voice
they
sound
like
the
bells
at
feldsberg
only
louder
and
prettier
they
are
doubtless
the
bells
of
sternfelden
church
replied
their
father
with
joy
take
my
arm
dear
wife
you
can
lean
on
michael
too
we
will
go
to
the
church
and
pray
to
god
to
help
us
and
to
incline
the
counts
heart
towards
us
they
rested
yet
awhile
listening
to
the
welcome
sound
of
the
bells
and
after
partaking
of
the
little
supply
of
food
given
them
by
the
good
peasant
katherine
was
once
more
able
to
proceed
and
taking
her
husbands
arm
soon
reached
the
summit
of
the
mountain
from
whence
a
glorious
prospect
met
their
gaze
a
rude
cross
marked
the
summit
sternfelden
with
its
beautiful
church
lay
at
no
great
distance
from
them
and
near
it
the
princely
castle
of
the
count
at
this
welcome
sight
our
little
party
fell
on
their
knees
and
offered
their
thanks
to
god
for
having
brought
them
through
so
many
perils
and
trials
to
their
journeys
end
they
knelt
regardless
of
the
snow
their
eyes
raised
to
heaven
and
their
sad
wan
faces
once
more
lit
up
with
hope
chapter
v
the
christening
it
was
with
no
common
feelings
of
thankfulness
that
our
little
party
entered
the
church
of
sternfelden
it
was
to
them
as
a
haven
of
rest
and
they
felt
more
immediately
under
the
protection
of
the
most
high
so
long
homeless
they
were
now
in
that
home
from
which
none
could
cast
them
out
so
long
houseless
they
had
now
entered
that
house
the
doors
of
which
are
open
to
all
the
light
the
warmth
the
pealing
music
all
seemed
to
cheer
the
weary
ones
even
the
marble
pavement
felt
warm
to
their
feet
benumbed
as
they
were
by
the
snowy
paths
they
had
so
lately
trodden
they
were
presently
aroused
by
the
entrance
of
a
woman
bearing
an
infant
enveloped
in
a
white
and
flowing
mantle
with
which
she
approached
the
baptismal
font
where
a
priest
awaited
her
a
lady
evidently
of
high
rank
was
already
there
she
was
richly
dressed
in
a
robe
of
black
velvet
bordered
with
ermine
whilst
her
fine
hair
over
which
a
long
veil
was
thrown
was
braided
with
jewels
two
attendants
stood
behind
the
lady
was
apparently
going
to
stand
sponsor
for
the
infant
about
to
be
baptised
gaspard
and
katherine
watched
the
ceremony
at
a
respectful
distance
but
the
three
boys
drew
nearer
partly
to
gaze
at
the
lady
whose
appearance
and
beauty
were
well
calculated
to
attract
their
attention
and
partly
to
look
at
a
ceremony
they
had
never
before
witnessed
when
the
priest
was
ready
to
receive
the
infant
the
nurse
withdrew
the
mantle
in
which
it
had
been
carefully
wrapped
to
protect
it
from
the
severe
cold
had
gaspard
and
katherine
been
nearer
neither
the
sacred
edifice
in
which
they
stood
nor
the
holy
service
which
was
going
on
would
scarce
have
prevented
an
exclamation
at
the
sight
of
the
little
cap
with
the
silver
star
which
the
infant
wore
none
however
seemed
to
notice
it
unless
it
was
that
that
caused
the
deadly
paleness
of
the
lady
as
she
raised
her
eyes
to
answer
for
the
child
on
the
conclusion
of
the
ceremony
the
nurse
presented
the
infant
to
the
countess
it
was
the
countess
de
sternfelden
herself
who
had
stood
for
it
to
receive
her
blessing
to
the
astonishment
of
all
present
she
exclaimed
in
a
voice
trembling
with
emotion
for
the
love
of
heaven
tell
me
where
this
cap
came
from
all
were
silent
apparently
no
one
could
answer
the
question
the
priest
alone
ventured
to
address
the
countess
asking
the
cause
of
her
agitation
father
she
said
as
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
cap
the
infant
wore
this
cap
belonged
to
the
child
we
lost
with
my
own
hands
i
embroidered
the
silver
star
the
badge
of
our
house
o
god
she
cried
sinking
on
her
knees
may
it
lead
to
the
discovery
of
our
lost
darling
the
priest
gently
raised
the
countess
looking
around
as
he
did
so
for
some
one
who
could
give
any
information
respecting
the
mysterious
cap
the
little
francis
had
now
advanced
close
to
the
party
around
the
baptismal
font
eager
with
childish
curiosity
to
see
the
infant
just
baptised
he
at
once
recognised
the
little
cap
he
had
been
accustomed
to
look
upon
with
peculiar
veneration
his
joy
at
again
seeing
it
overcame
his
timidity
he
exclaimed
with
delight—
that
cap
is
mine
i
wore
it
when
i
was
little
all
eyes
were
now
turned
on
our
little
francis
the
priest
approached
him
and
taking
him
kindly
by
the
hand
led
him
to
the
countess
she
gazed
for
a
moment
as
if
in
admiration
of
the
face
now
raised
to
hers
then
said
in
a
trembling
voice—
oh
tell
me
if
this
cap
was
really
yours
how
it
came
here
who
are
your
parents
and
where
are
they
yes
yes
lady
the
cap
is
mine
the
wife
of
the
wicked
steward
at
feldsberg
took
it
she
made
him
take
everything
we
had
we
have
come
all
the
way
from
feldsberg
and
my
father
and
mother
are
here
fetch
them
fetch
them
quickly
said
the
countess
that
they
may
tell
me
about
this
child
and
this
cap
good
father
she
added
turning
to
the
priest
may
i
not
hope
to
have
found
my
child
do
you
not
see
a
likeness
to
my
noble
husband
the
good
man
feared
to
encourage
hopes
which
might
not
be
realised
but
was
spared
answering
the
question
by
the
approach
of
gaspard
and
his
wife
the
countess
advanced
towards
them
holding
francis
by
the
hand
tell
me
my
friend
is
this
child
yours
no
lady
replied
gaspard
he
is
only
our
adopted
child
but
interrupted
katherine
he
is
as
dear
to
us
as
if
he
was
our
own
the
countess
then
pointed
to
the
cap
saying
as
she
did
so—how
came
this
cap
into
your
possession
he
says
it
was
his
i
emplore
you
to
tell
me
all
you
know
about
it
i
will
tell
you
everything
lady
replied
gaspard
he
then
shortly
related
how
he
had
found
and
rescued
the
boy
how
carefully
he
and
his
wife
had
treasured
the
little
cap
of
their
settling
at
feldsberg
and
lastly
of
the
treatment
they
had
met
with
in
consequence
of
their
refusal
to
part
with
the
cap
how
it
came
to
be
where
he
now
saw
it
he
could
not
tell
the
countesss
tears
fell
fast
during
the
recital
when
it
was
ended
she
turned
to
one
of
her
women
agatha
said
she
go
and
fetch
the
count
and
my
brother
tell
them
our
child
is
restored
to
us
then
clasping
francis
in
her
arms
she
said
as
she
tenderly
embraced
him
i
am
indeed
your
mother
god
has
heard
my
prayers
and
has
restored
you
to
me
my
child
it
was
near
metz
that
you
were
taken
from
us
you
wore
this
little
cap
the
day
we
lost
you
oh
you
will
try
and
love
us
now
you
are
restored
to
us
then
taking
the
astonished
child
by
the
hand
the
countess
approached
the
altar
and
kneeling
on
the
steps
appeared
to
be
engaged
in
silent
prayer
gaspard
and
his
wife
followed
her
example
at
a
little
distance
their
hearts
were
also
overflowing
with
thankfulness
on
rising
from
this
act
of
devotion
the
countess
turned
to
the
good
soldier
saying
as
she
did
so—
may
heaven
reward
you
and
your
good
wife
i
cannot
only
say
what
we
can
do
to
show
our
gratitude
she
was
interrupted
by
the
little
francis
who
leading
michael
and
john
to
her
said—
these
are
my
brothers
do
not
take
them
from
me
no
no
dear
child
replied
the
countess
as
she
took
a
hand
of
each
they
shall
stay
with
you
and
you
will
not
leave
your
adopted
child
she
added
turning
to
gaspard
and
katherine
the
count
and
countess
de
sternfelden
had
thus
restored
to
them
their
lost
and
only
child
the
only
heir
of
their
noble
house
for
whom
they
had
so
deeply
mourned
our
good
soldier
and
his
family
were
as
unexpectedly
rescued
from
want
and
misery
and
assured
of
kindness
and
protection
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
one
more
cause
of
rejoicing
was
in
store
for
gaspard
as
our
happy
party
were
about
to
leave
the
church
the
countesss
brother
advanced
towards
him
gaspard
said
he
as
he
held
out
his
hand
to
him
my
old
and
brave
comrade
in
arms
do
you
not
know
me
gaspard
at
once
recognised
the
young
baron
otto
de
helfenstein
my
captain
my
noble
captain
he
said
i
never
thought
to
see
you
again
we
could
never
hear
anything
of
you
and
feared
you
were
either
killed
or
taken
prisoner
i
was
taken
prisoner
by
the
french
returned
the
baron
and
when
i
got
my
exchange
i
joined
our
army
in
spain
and
went
with
it
afterwards
to
italy
i
only
returned
to
my
own
country
two
days
ago
when
i
saw
my
sister
for
the
first
time
since
her
loss
i
little
imagined
that
the
child
you
so
bravely
rescued
was
hers
the
count
interrupted
further
explanations
by
proposing
that
all
should
go
to
the
castle
where
they
could
at
leisure
hear
and
relate
all
that
would
be
deeply
interesting
to
the
whole
party
the
news
had
spread
rapidly
through
the
village
the
inhabitants
of
which
hastened
to
meet
the
little
procession
and
to
testify
their
joy
at
the
happy
event
the
count
was
universally
beloved
by
his
dependents
and
now
received
heartfelt
congratulations
from
all
on
the
recovery
of
his
lost
child
on
reaching
the
castle
he
gave
orders
for
a
day
of
general
rejoicing
in
which
all
classes
should
join
promising
at
the
same
time
that
every
year
the
anniversary
of
the
day
on
which
his
son
was
restored
to
him
should
be
kept
as
a
holiday
amongst
his
people
the
remainder
of
the
day
on
which
the
little
francis
was
restored
to
his
parents
was
spent
in
relating
the
various
events
which
had
led
to
his
loss
and
recovery
it
appeared
that
shortly
before
the
disappearance
of
the
little
heir
of
the
house
of
sternfelden
a
keeper
of
the
counts
had
been
dismissed
for
repeated
acts
of
gross
misconduct
and
treachery
which
had
as
often
been
pardoned
by
the
count
after
his
final
disgrace
this
man
had
been
heard
to
threaten
that
he
would
have
his
revenge
on
the
disappearance
of
the
child
this
man
was
suspected
the
more
so
that
he
was
nowhere
to
be
heard
of
though
every
effort
was
made
to
trace
him
and
to
obtain
some
eke
that
might
lead
to
discovering
what
had
become
of
the
infant
the
unhappy
and
bereaved
parents
learnt
after
a
while
that
the
wretch
had
crossed
the
rhine
and
it
was
supposed
he
had
joined
the
french
army
near
metz
hither
they
followed
in
the
hope
of
gaining
some
tidings
of
their
lost
treasure
the
search
was
fruitless
nothing
could
be
heard
of
either
the
unhappy
count
and
countess
returned
heartbroken
to
their
own
childless
home
on
hearing
gaspards
account
it
was
easy
to
imagine
that
the
wretch
had
carried
the
child
with
him
when
he
joined
the
french
that
he
had
been
with
those
who
had
defended
the
fort
the
day
it
was
attacked
and
taken
by
the
germans
and
had
probably
met
with
the
fate
he
so
well
merited
whilst
the
little
francis
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
brave
soldier
and
his
kindhearted
wife
the
countess
learnt
from
katherine
why
they
had
given
their
adopted
child
the
name
of
francis
which
by
a
singular
chance
was
the
name
he
had
received
from
his
own
parents
little
now
remained
to
be
told
or
learnt
save
that
the
little
cap
which
had
so
providentially
led
to
the
recovery
of
the
lost
child
had
been
sent
by
the
wife
of
the
steward
of
feldsberg
to
her
sister
at
sternfelden
as
a
gift
to
her
firstborn
that
which
the
unfeeling
woman
had
so
eagerly
coveted
and
which
she
had
obtained
by
such
unjustifiable
means
may
possibly
have
become
a
source
of
trouble
instead
of
gratification
to
her
she
could
it
may
be
supposed
scarcely
look
at
the
little
cap
so
prized
by
those
from
whom
she
had
torn
it
without
some
feelings
of
selfreproach
and
may
have
been
glad
to
have
got
rid
of
it
by
bestowing
it
on
one
wholly
unacquainted
with
its
history
and
who
had
therefore
no
scruple
in
accepting
and
making
use
of
it
she
may
have
quieted
her
conscience
by
thus
removing
from
her
sight
that
which
reproached
her
but
she
could
not
escape
the
punishment
she
so
well
merited
and
that
which
seemed
but
a
trifle
was
the
means
of
bringing
to
light
the
stewards
misconduct
as
well
as
his
wifes
and
the
ruin
they
sought
to
bring
on
others
who
had
never
injured
them
fell
upon
themselves
all
was
now
joy
and
thankfulness
in
the
castle
of
sternfelden
and
our
poor
wanderers
had
found
the
relief
and
rest
they
so
greatly
needed
they
were
not
suppliants
but
honoured
guests
in
the
counts
castle
with
every
comfort
provided
for
them
and
receiving
that
respect
and
regard
they
so
well
deserved
the
day
following
ere
the
public
rejoicings
commenced
the
little
francis
de
sternfelden
entered
the
apartment
in
which
were
gaspard
and
katherine
he
had
not
forgotten
that
it
was
katherines
birthday
putting
his
arms
round
her
neck
and
kissing
her
affectionately
he
said—
dear
good
mother
your
little
francis
has
brought
you
a
birthday
present
so
saying
he
put
into
her
hands
a
paper
which
proved
to
be
a
deed
giving
to
gaspard
and
his
wife
a
farm
on
the
counts
estate
at
no
great
distance
front
the
castle
with
tears
of
grateful
joy
did
the
good
couple
recall
the
day
on
which
gaspard
had
presented
the
little
francis
to
his
wife
and
it
was
now
through
him
that
they
received
a
gift
which
they
looked
upon
as
far
beyond
their
deserts
and
which
more
than
repaid
them
for
all
their
trials
and
anxieties
the
count
would
scarcely
receive
any
thanks
he
felt
he
could
never
repay
all
they
had
done
for
his
child
and
that
to
them
under
providence
he
owed
his
present
unlookedfor
happiness
and
that
of
the
countess
whose
health
had
seriously
suffered
from
her
terrible
loss
by
another
deed
the
count
restored
to
gaspard
his
little
property
at
feldsberg
where
he
also
appointed
another
steward
in
the
place
of
one
who
had
so
cruelly
abused
the
power
entrusted
to
him
gaspard
had
the
satisfaction
of
offering
the
little
cottage
and
land
at
feldsberg
at
a
nominal
rent
to
their
kind
neighbour
christine
and
her
son—an
offer
which
was
gladly
accepted
peace
and
plenty
and
comfort
greater
than
any
they
had
ever
before
enjoyed
were
henceforward
the
portion
of
the
good
and
brave
soldier
and
his
family
and
above
all
they
had
the
approbation
of
their
own
consciences
and
could
feel
that
by
their
honest
endeavours
to
do
what
they
believed
to
be
right
they
had
secured
the
respect
and
goodwill
of
all
who
knew
them
they
lived
to
see
their
two
sons
grow
up
receiving
by
the
counts
help
such
an
education
as
fitted
them
for
respectable
situations—michael
hoping
one
day
to
obtain
that
of
steward
to
his
patron
they
had
also
the
happiness
of
seeing
the
young
francis
grow
up
in
every
way
worthy
of
his
high
station
whilst
he
ever
treated
them
with
the
tenderest
regard
and
affection
which
the
good
count
and
countess
afforded
him
every
opportunity
of
showing
the
history
of
this
good
couple
may
remind
our
readers
of
the
words
of
the
psalmist
put
thou
thy
trust
in
the
lord
and
be
doing
good
dwell
in
the
land
and
verily
thou
shalt
be
fed
